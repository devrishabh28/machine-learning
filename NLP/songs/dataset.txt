Come on now
Dry your eyes
I'm sick of all your lies
I've grown to despise you
Already sick of what you're saying
Hoping now I'm only praying
My baby's gone away
And I've already packed my bags
You didn't know me
(I've run away)
You couldn't show me
(What you have to say)
My one and only
Has gone away
Far away
You'll never leave me alone
Now I'm off on my own
I'll never ring your phone again
And still you keep on crying
If I said I loved you
I'd be lying
You need to dry your eyes
And I've still gone to pack my bags
You didn't know me
(I've run away)
You couldn't show me
(What you have to say)
My one and only
Has gone away
You didn't know me
(I've run away)
You couldn't show me
(What you have to say)
My one and only
Has gone away
Far away
Strings on my guitar are rusty
Even my best friends don't trust me
Everybody thinks I must be crazy
'Cos, I'm your typical average teen
If you know what I mean
(Typical average teen)
'Cos, I'm your typical average teen
If you know what I mean
(Typical average teen)
Everything's in a haze
Yeah, the drink's got me in a daze
Everything's blurry
Oh, what's happened to me?
Say, I'm your typical average teen
If you know what I mean
(Typical average teen)
Now, I'm your typical average teen
If you know what I mean
(Typical average teen) 
I think I took too much
I'm addicted to your touch
But I'm crying
In shame again
And now I'm high as a kite
And I know I might be gone
When you get home
Oh well, we've come this far
You're my Venus
And I'm your Mars
And we've passed the moon
and stars
And I'm gone
But now I'm high as a kite
And I know I'm might be gone
When you get home
I'm high as a kite
And I know I'm almost gone
When you get home
So please come home
I'm standing on a mountain
Waiting for you to come
You were sitting counting
The days that I had gone
The note I wrote
I wrapped up in a cigarette
Burned away the memories
I tried to forget
But not yet
Wishing my life away
But these three words
I have to say to you
My baby blue
You know it's true
I love you
I love you
How can I tell you?
I don't know what to say
This chance that I won't miss
But I miss you anyway
I feel your pain
It's turning me insane
Thrown away
I had to take the last train home
But then you came
Wishing my life away
But these three words
I have to say to you
My baby blue
You know it's true
I love you
Wishing my life away
These three words
I have to say to you
My baby blue
You know it's true
You know it's true
I love you
I love you
I love you
Well, I've walked this street
Well, I've walked this street before
And everyone's locked up their door
'Cos they heard me coming
And I've been running
From what
I don't know if she's there
Or if she's cares
It's taken you a long time to see
You've got a goldfish memory
This song's for you, not for me
In misery
You said we went too fast
And you said we wouldn't last
Now I've put the past behind me
And I'm running
From what
I don't know if she's there
Or if she cares
It's taken you a long time to see
You've got a goldfish memory
This song's for you, not for me
In misery
It's taken you a long time to see
In misery
And everyone's locked up their door
'Cos they heard me coming
And I've been running
From what
I don't know if she's there
Or if she's cares
It's taken you a long time to see
You've got a goldfish memory
This song's for you, not for me
In misery
You said we went too fast
And you said we wouldn't last
Now I've put the past behind me
And I'm running
From what
I don't know if she's there
Or if she cares
It's taken you a long time to see
You've got a goldfish memory
This song's for you, not for me
In misery
It's taken you a long time to see
In misery
Can’t get you off my mind
Look at me and you will find
Time after time it seems
I’ll say what I don’t mean
In your world we were the same
In mine now you’re the one to blame
You can’t remember my name
We’re lost, it’s such a shame
Listen to me
Stop making me see
What I’ve been waiting for
Listen to me
Stop making me see
I’m strong yet proud
I’m quiet yet loud
And I’m everything
You want in me
I’m small yet tall
I have it all
And I’m everything
You want me to be
Listen to me
Stop making me see
What I’ve been waiting for
Listen to me
Stop making me see
And I still feel like
I need you still
And I still feel like
I’m on some pill
And I still feel like
I need you still
Listen to me
Stop making me see
What I’ve been waiting for
Listen to me
Making me see
Just lay it all down on me
It’s getting harder for me to breathe
Just want to know if it will be
Just want to know if it is me
And you know I’ve learned from my mistakes
And how much have I got to lose?
You find my heart is hard to break
Can’t keep playing the fool
Breathe in, exhale
To turn to move beyond the pale
Flag up, set sail
To find what’s there beyond the pale
I feel like I’ve gone to the end of the world
What do I have to do?
You know I’ve learned from my mistakes
How much have I got to lose?
You find my heart hard to break
Can’t keep playing the fool
Breathe in, exhale
To turn to move beyond the pale
Flag up, set sail
To find what’s there beyond the pale
What can I do
Just to let you know
That you’re in my mind?
To try and justify
The way you liberate me
Every time
I write this song in memory of
The wayward smile
The boy we won't forget
The soul you took away from us
The river flows
The tears that we wept
Missing you
Is all that needs to be said
More than blue
The words inside my head
And I know that you're gone
And I know that you're gone
The cheeky smile
Of jokes and laughs
The memories of times
We crossed the line
The stepping stones
Across my mind
Washed away
We all now feel so blind
Missing you
Is all that needs to be said
More than blue
The words inside my head
And I know that you're gone
I know that you're gone
I know that you're gone
I know that you're gone
Goodbye
I’m getting very edgy
Cos you’re trying to take this from me
And it’s something that I wanted so bad
Cos you’re the definition
Of someone who has to ruin
The best thing that I ever had
Cos you’re a jealous girl
And all I can say is
It’s your fault but partially mine
For losing hope
For not treating you right
But that will disappear in time

All I gotta do is pass you by
Never say what’s wrong
Whenever I say why?

Standing in the corner
Shadowed by the light
To you I seem much smaller
But I know it might be you
How much better could I do
To be myself, not someone else?
I’m losing sleep
I live only for the week
I’ve grown to ignore you
Cos when I seem to bore you
You pretend that you’re not interested
Your eyes start to twinkle
Your smile starts to widen
And I just seem to try and forget
But you pay me no attention
Even though I do
But I don’t care as long as you’re mine
It’s happening every time
All I gotta do is pass you by
Never say what’s wrong
Whenever I say why?
Standing in the corner
Shadowed by the light
To you I seem much smaller
But I know it might be you
How much better could I do
To be myself, not someone else?
I’m losing sleep
I live only for the week
And I’m falling harder now it seems
My slip-ups haunt me in my dreams
And I can’t sleep although I think I can
It’s insomnia I think I have
But who cares when I’m not your man?
Standing in the corner
Shadowed by the light
To you I seem much smaller
But I know it might be you
How much better could I do
To be myself, not someone else?
I’m losing sleep
I live only for the week
In shadow there lies hope
Cut tension with a knife
I find it hard to cope
Stop playing with my life
You analyze my fears
Analyze my dreams
Choke on burning tears
Through my silent screams
Things aren't what they seem
Tell a hundred craftsmen to work on me
Tell this army of angels to make me breathe
Open doors just to take away the key
I'll let you all see that I'm doing better
Watch me fall
As I stumble at your feet
Always losing in this game
Your lies cut me deep
And you don't even know my name
With your consistency
To always watch me crawl
And my durability
Not affected at all
Still things aren't what they seem
Tell a hundred craftsmen to work on me
Tell this army of angels to make me breathe
Open doors just to take away the key
I'll let you all see that I'm doing better
Feel the pain
On my brain
Feel the strain
As I start to decay
Feel the strain
Every passing day
Feel the pain
As I start to decay
Tell a hundred craftsmen to work on me
Tell this army of angels to make me breathe
Open doors just to take away the key
I'll let you all see that I'm doing better
I’m screaming out upon my face
Followed footsteps catch my pace
Broken windows fall in place
Now shattered lovers find their place
We’d flirt
And you’d treat me like dirt
All the pain and the hurt
Just to make matters worse
And I see you all over him
Irresistible sin
When can we be the same again?
What can I do to be making you see?
To come out clean?
You’re better off with me
We’re stuck
Taking time and wasting mine
No luck
Running around and crashing down
In you I trust nevermore
Leaving you in sand and glass
All I ever felt for you
Went up in a cloud of smoke
How I could I be such a fool
To ever think that we were close?
And I see you all over him
Irresistible sin
When can we be the same again?
What can I do to be making you see?
To come out clean?
You’re better off with me
We’re stuck
Taking time and wasting mine
No luck
Running around and crashing down
In you I trust nevermore
Leaving you in sand and glass
Stevie was a boy
Who turned into a man
He never had no master plan
But I knew that he could
Find right from wrong
Sing me a different song
He told me which road to take
And now I’m gone
Keep on singing
Make her life whole
Stevie you’re winning
And I just feel cold
Take your life beyond the mark
You can do no wrong
When I lose my way in the dark
Keep singing your song
Please come follow me
I find it hard to breathe
Please come follow me
I find it hard to breathe
Mr Ruskin come and paint my picture
We’re losing sleep 'cos we steal the week
Now who’s your best friend?
Can you introduce me?
See I can’t seem to even let you breathe
When I dance with Billy Ruskin in my mind’s eye
Please let me forget that I’m standing on my own
And I am my own best friend and I need me to see
That I am more than what is hiding in me
Come and show me if you can
See I know you’re me
But I can’t seem to understand
If you know me, place my hand on mine
And we will resurrect the time
That we lost when you left my mind
It’s psycho-paranoia disappearing in time
Come and show me what makes you tick
I need you to get out of my mind quick
When I dance with Billy Ruskin in my mind’s eye
Please let me forget that I’m standing on my own
And I am my own best friend and I need me to see
That I am more than what is hiding in me
Take me with you I do declare
I love you dearly through here and there
What can I do to make you share?
What can I do to make you care?
The world is harsh
I’m stuck in the dark
I’ll make my mark
I’ve got my spark
We’d be together through bad or worse
Sending letters we shall converse
We could do better but we must first
Make amends
That depends
Will you be my friend?
The world is harsh
I’m stuck in the dark
I’ll make my mark
I’ve got my spark
You know I got to get away
To find some peace and sanity
I’ve been playing hide-and-seek too long
Shaking, making, everybody waking
Setting the hi-fi bleed
Keeping me back
While you’re spinning my track
That’ll knock you off your feet
Monkey see what monkey do
But I’m a monkey telling you
I just think that we should take a break
Tickity-tock the clock
With the hip-hop
And alonestar backing me up
We won’t stop
I gotta be searching for my peace of mind
Now let the track rewind
And play, let the music play
It came, so let the music say what it feels
Shame, shame it took too long
To see that you were wrong
Now turn the song back on
This is Alonestar coming at you
With a new style
Kicking dust
Ready to bust
It's Urban Angel
Artistic, flipping the script
Who d'you really want to get it with?
Ed and Alonestar
We're like live wires sparking
Ready to blow
We've already sown our seeds
We're just waiting to grow - blow
We're gonna lift you like a shock to your body
Metaphorical speech when we come and see
You ducking for cover
Sheeran Lock coming ready to rock
With Urban Angel and Alonestar
And Ed - keep it locked
Let the beat pump
Drop the bass but don't stop
We're kicking the sound
Let the bass bins pound
We're gonna roll
Can you feel me now with my body?
Get down to the sound
It's Ed Sheeran in the place
And Alonestar rising up
We gotta rise up
I said rise up
And play, let the music play
It came, so let the music say what it feels
Shame, shame it took so long
To see that you were wrong
Now turn the song back on
Pass me a drink
You say it’s gonna take a while
Your consciousness sinks
Tears from a crocodile
You’re wasting your time
Giving me the speech
You try to, don’t reach
Your smile
You’re holding your tears
Your inside is dead
You’re eating your fears
In a cigarette
You’ve waited too long
To finally see
The sunshine in the rain
Is as deep as the sea
I’ve taken the blow
It’s all down on paper
Had fun in the snow
But no ‘see you later’
You’re wasting your time
Giving me the speech
You try to, don’t reach
Your smile
You’re holding your tears
Your inside is dead
You’re eating your fears
In a cigarette
You’ve waited too long
To finally see
The sunshine in the rain
Is as deep as the sea
Well I once heard a story about a run-down home
Where a man and his thoughts lived all alone
He tried to live, no effort was shown
He’s slowly finding a way back home
He had a family with smiles and frowns
They never could solve his way to be down
Cos he’s one dog who don’t want a bone
He’s slowly finding a way back home
He had a nice house with windows and doors
He said to his wife what’s mine is yours
But the seeds of deception are soon to be sown
He’s slowly finding a way back home
His children have left but the rooms are still there
His misses the noise and the scents in their hair
But far from the nest the babies have flown
He’s slowly finding a way back home
His wife was an angel sent from above
He never returned her kisses or love
But soon he’d found that she’d overgrown
This man who’s finding a way back home
So the leaves are all dead in this broken man’s June
The rain will still fall on the sunny afternoon
He stares at the floor, no more to roam
He’s slowly finding a way back home
Well I once heard a story about a run-down home
Where a man with regrets lived all alone
He tried to live, no effort was shown
He’ll never find a way back home
I want to be real
Not some conscience to myself
The way you worship, never ending
Some idol who’s pretending to be true
How you put upon yourself
A man who never seems
To answer to you words
So go and make me over
I’m a fly upon your neck
You can’t control me
I have my words, my voice
My strengths, my choice
And I can cut as deep
Just as deep as I need
Don’t want your advice
Cos I’ve made up my own mind
The way you bore me with the stories
Of far and distant times
I’ve heard it before
So don’t try that on me
The way you worship, never-ending
Some idol who’s pretending to be true
It could be you
Brainwashed by the lies
It’s no surprise
That you’d wanna waste your time
I’m a fly upon your neck
You can’t control me
I have my words, my voice
My strengths, my choice
And I can cut as deep
Just as deep as I need
Well my friend it seems we’ve come too far to disagree
My knees feel weak and I fell too fast
The tide is high but we swam in too deep
To catch your breath you tear me apart piece by piece
You can take away all this mess
And I could never think anything less of you
‘Cos you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all I have left
The tide flows out as I leave empty rooms
To spur this on we left that room too long
You open wide and all the lies flow out
To eat you whole
But we both know that you’re too cold
And she said ‘I can put away all those lies
And show you there’s no surprise in me’
Well still, you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all that I have left
Exorcise these demons
But they keep talking to me
I am no believer
But I believe you will relieve me
I believe you will relieve me
And that’s what’s going on
‘Cos you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all that I have left
You break me
It’s been a while since we were here
Been too long my fear is
Holding back the memories of your eyes
Scattered notes and broken glass you had left me
All that’s left is shattered hearts
It’s plain enough for us to see that
You’ve got me
You’ve got me
We’re just friends tangled up in loose ends
I feel it coming around again
Let me know where you let your heart go
And I will just pretend
That I have never felt this way
Since you I have never felt this way
Since you
I feel strange
Playing games
It’s no fuss
I’m not in love
Twisted tunes, a melody of spite
If you give me the words then I might
Let go unknown feelings
Telling me that I cannot fight
When you speak that shite
Let go unknown feelings
Telling me that
You’ve got me
You’ve got me
We’re just friends tangled up in loose ends
I feel it coming around again
Let me know where you let your heart go
And I will just pretend
That I have never felt this way
Since you I have never felt this way
Since you
I feel strange
Playing games
It’s no fuss
I’m not in love
I lost it in your kiss, your lips,
Sweetness, in your smile
Your words make me whole
But your scars demand a healer’s touch
It’s true
I’m glad I’m not you
Well I walked from my house to yours
In a warm cold April rain
We barely went outdoors
And your family took the blame
Take time to be with you
She can only glare
I’m a bad influence, that’ll do
‘Cos I need to cut my hair
Wash my mouth, change my clothes
Just don’t talk to those friends of yours
Tell them not to come here anymore
Time to go, don’t be slow
This’ll only take a mo’
Take yourself right out of my door
It’s just that they don’t care
Dad said beware, watch your back
Just don’t reply to that woman there
And even if she makes a fuss
Just ignore that trust
And don’t give in to lust
And leave that one alone
The girl’s trouble
Time spent in burnt-down shed
Add up near two days
Fall down and cut my head
Take time to misbehave
Spend time and be with you
She can only glare
‘Cos you’re a bad influence, that’ll do
Boy you need to cut your hair
Wash your mouth, change your clothes
Just don’t talk to those friends of yours
Tell them not to come here anymore
Time to go, don’t be slow
This’ll only take a mo’
Take yourself right out of my door
It’s just that they don’t care
Dad said beware, watch your back
Just don’t reply to that woman there
And even if she makes a fuss
Just ignore that trust
And don’t give in to lust
And leave that one alone
This is the dancing song
Close your eyes
Hypnotise to the beat
And the movement of the week
Do that shuffle of your feet
And pound out the fever, either
Dance as you’re a true believer
Cleaner lives are what you don’t see
Fell the weight, gravitate
Feel the pace of me
This world is 2D
The only thing that’s free in life is love
And that don’t come cheap
It’s just that they don’t care
Dad said beware, watch your back
Just don’t reply to that woman there
And even if she makes a fuss
Just ignore that trust
And don’t give in to lust
And leave that one alone
The girl’s trouble
Sara, what you do to me is enlighten my mind
Oh wow, I said
Sara, what you do to me is make my soul unwind
Hey now
‘Cos your hair is blonde, your eyes are blue
Half the guys I know are after you
Cheer me up when I'm in a mood
So I thought I'd write a song for you
And may I say, you look like an angel today
May I say, take me to the place where your mind lays
If only to make you smile today
‘Cos you are great, I thought I'd say that
Sara, reminds me of drunken talks in a hammock
Behind a can of Strongbow
Oh wow, I said
Sara, you say that you don't look good when you do
Even with that soul
Your hair is blonde, your eyes are blue
Half the guys I know are after you
Cheer me up when I'm in a mood
So I thought I'd write a song for you
And may I say, you look like an angel today
May I say, take me to the place where your mind lays
If only to make you smile today
‘Cos you are great, I thought I'd say that
May I say, you look great
May I play this to make your day
Now it seems I’ve been young, dug my hole in the ground
To me there’s only up, there ain’t no point in looking down
However hard I try, I only get weaker
Seems my lies and worries got my mind in a sleeper hold
What you gotta do is never get yourself down
Bastards do that for you, get you deeper in the ground
Keep out of trouble, ain’t no trouble being pure
Seems like all you bastards gave me something to ignore now
Move on, forget it
Now move on, forget it
When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
And made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark
And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody
Hennesey shots and glocks, all these fools on the block
Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top?
I'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy
With my head in the sky
Ed Sheeran, Urban Angel coming ready to die
So see the signs, stand to the side
Open your eyes and take a look and realise
The resurrection's arrived
And as the mist clears, homie I arise
From my tomb in disguise
I'm all alone, Alonestar
Urban Angel rising from the ashes
Surprising all haters, guiding, advising them all to steady move
Now back up!
Move on, forget it
Now move on, forget it
All I want in this cold world is to make music and use it
Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music
Who did it, who is it, who's in it, who …what the fuck does it matter?
Chitter chatter, don't matter, yidder, yidder, yadder
It don't matter to me
All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely
To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?
Yeah, yeah, can you hear me?
I felt the fall on my breast
At the bottom of my stomach
She put my hand on her chest
While she looked into my eyes
You rescued me
And called up these words in threes
And you know I can’t forget it
And 10 months on you liberate truth
See, I was wrong on how I hate you
And it’s the worst thing that I did
When I read through you
You weren’t translated
So I looked up love in the Yellow Pages
So I’d be free from it
See, all this truth sparks lies in me
Just to demonstrate, aggravate sympathy
The key is just to ignore
Even if this time has made me unsure
And 12 months on I’m back in my mood
See, I got drunk and said I loved you
And it’s the worst thing that I did
When I read through you
You weren’t translated
So I looked up love in the Yellow Pages
So I’d be free from it
Just give me a pen and I’ll write my worries
Now and again I’ll try and not see that you don’t care
Taking the time to taste and savour
Life’s bitter wine and childish behaviour
But you don’t care
And hey, I don’t speak that language of youth
And hey, oh not the one that speaks truth
And hey, I lay in this world for a while
When all is lost just smile
They’ve written the dates and the times to follow
See all the fakes that look so hollow
But you don’t care
What ever happened to the youth and culture?
Wear chains and the same fecking Lonsdale jumper
So you don’t care
And hey, I don’t speak that language of youth
And hey, oh not the one that speaks truth
And hey, I lay in this world for a while
When all is lost just smile
Face me, are you tired of living?
Replace, she was so unforgiving
And I’m so frustrated, so dilated
And she’s telling me I’ve wasted my time
And I’m running back like, just to face the facts right
To tell me your voice takes me through the night
Your smile and your memory
Simply eases me to sleep
In my ear while the whispering
Melts my heart on every beat
Still you’re singing lullabies and postcards to this place
And we’re asking for so much more
Now you’re bringing smiles and laughter to this face
While bad memories are in pieces on the floor
Face me, are you tired of living?
Replace, she was so unforgiving
And I’m so frustrated, so dilated
And she’s telling me I’ve wasted my time
And I’m running back like, just to face the facts right
To tell me your voice takes me through the night
Time past, heal this broken heart
Pulled away that sellotape
Take your time, ‘cos I won’t mind
I doubt if I even know that I’m awake
And still you’re singing lullabies and postcards to this place
And we’re asking for so much more
Now you’re bringing smiles and laughter to this face
While bad memories are in pieces on the floor
Sing the song Celestial Man
Shake the thing your mother gave ya!
Tear your lungs out, scream your heart
Be on your worst behaviour
I’d wager that you’re gonna take it
Make you fight nature, born and raised in
Funk those things that make you go bump in the night
Turn off the dark, put on the light
And he said ‘You and your big cheeks have got me’
Along with ‘Disarm’ and ‘Flooded Quarry’
Turn off the base with the beat-box detox
Pull off the pace, while you sing with no socks
Lampshades, carpets, the stage black
You make the room’s hands laugh as they clap
You make my mouth water with support acts
They could even match you in talent - ignore that!
Gary Dunne and Newton Faulkner ain’t wrong
He’s got me singing to ‘Amerikan Folk Song’
Loop pedal class is used as weaponry
You gotta know your enemy
Gotta check your distance
Don’t talk, only whisper
Slap the base so hard you get blisters
Chikka boom, boom, chikka boom
JP beat-box, feet as flip-flops
Doing the hip hop, mixed with the warm sock
And Stephanie propped up, up by the mic stand
This ain’t no fake, it’s music in your hand
As you run into the centre of the crowd
Silence falls like water
You just wanna shout ‘Wow!’
How did they even have the guts to do it ?
If your name’s Nizlopi, then there ain’t much to it
‘Cos you and your big cheeks have got me spinning around now
Sorrow and sadness, bitterness, grief
Memories I have of you
Won't leave me in peace
My mind was running back
To the west coast of Clare
Thinking of you
And the times we had there
I walked to Spanish Point
I knew I'd find you there
I stood on the white strand
You were everywhere
Vivid memories fade
But the mood still remains
I wish I could go back
And be with you again
In Milltown there's a pub
It’s there that I sat down
I see you everywhere
Your face is all around
The search for times past
Contains such sweet pain
I'll banish lonesome thoughts
But they’ll return again
I walk along the shore
The rain in my face
My mind is numb with grief
Of you there is no trace
I'll think of this again
In far off lands I roam
Walking with you
By this cold Atlantic fog
Sorrow and sadness, bitterness, grief
Memories I have of you
Won't leave me in peace
My mind was running back
To the west coast of Clare
Thinking of you
And the times we had there
I found the words to say how I feel
But I just can’t spell them
I lost the nerve in a Suffolk field
So you can tell them
That I’m a different man with a different tune
I didn’t find love until last June
But I lost it, just like I lost it all
I tried to use it to break my fall
‘Cos I need something, anything to replace you
Or something close
Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now
See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me
I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse
Hell, don't need another word-smith to make my tune sell.
Call yourself a singer-writer. You're just bluffing
Name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit school
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at The Enterprise when some fella filmed me
'A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi'
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me,
'Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop 'til my name's in lights
At stadium heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young I know my brother's gonna give me advice
Long-nighter, short height, and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter
The game's over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
'Cause people think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows
But I haven't got a house, plus I live on the couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out, wow
From day one I've been prepared
With VO5 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa, giving a dose of what the future holds
'Cause it's another day plus
I'll keep my last name forever, keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rapper's shoes using new laces
I'm selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows, if I'm not, I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me,
Still got a rucksack for the old clothes,
I rap with the cold flows,
I'm back with the old jokes,
In fact you don't know,
On tracks I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant,
If you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate,
Man, flows developing,
Skin lacks the melanin,
Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in,
I do it for the hell of it,
'Cause ever since I hit the mainstream with the A team,
I seem to sell a bit,
I took what held me back with the women,
And then I packaged the image,
Put in some content,
And then I sold it back as a gimmick,
The fact is this,
I'll end up dating actresses,
Wake up on dirty mattresses,
I think I need to practice this,
But I make shit happen, call me a laxative,
World's on my shoulders,
I don't even know what Atlas is,
Hard part's sharp like a cactus is,
I'm back to rapping back to back
'Cause I've been practicing,
I'm back to sing this
Filled up with doubt
I have to move home
But I want to stay with you
For all of the summer
I have my plan
That you won't remember
If you want to see the world
Then please ask your mother
I cannot hold your hand
To watch you go
I am a liar
As you might know
I need you now
I need your touch
And your lips
I need that smile
I need your smile
And your kiss
You're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so
You're so
I see your grace
From my window
When it is late at night
It'll show me your shadow
I'm in my place
Hope you remember
When summer's gone
I'll still sing a song
Of you in September
I see your voice
From my window
When it is late at night
It'll show me your shadow
I have my plan
But you won't remember it
But if you want to see the world
Then please ask your mother
I cannot hold your hand
To watch you go
I am a liar
As you might know
I need you now
I need your touch
And your lips
I need that smile
I need your smile
And your kiss
You're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so
You're so
These words I say mean
You're so amazing
And I've noticed lately
I need you, maybe
'Cause you're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so
You're so
And happy days
That left us on the floor
And you breathe me
And you squeeze me
'Til you're not feeling sure
Everything will brighten up
If we go to Brighton
I'll take you along the Pier
Everything will lighten up
if you feel too frightened
And if you feel too frightened
I'll make things disappear, dear
Darling, don't be nervous
I'll understand if you let me go
I did this on purpose
Now, 'cause when I'm missing you
I'll stop eating food
And I'll squeeze into a dress
So I can be like you
And then I'll see your bitterness
And why you're leaving too
Maybe, I'll put you to a test
And say that I love you
I think that I love you
And sunny days
That left my skin dark red
And you squeeze me
And you breathe me
'Til these thoughts leave my head
If it gets too complicated
I'll give up and be frustrated
Can you see what's wrong?
If you feel like you've been hated
If you feel like you've been jaded and
This love's too overrated
See what's going on, mmm
Darling, don't be nervous
I'll understand if you let me go
I did this on purpose
Now, 'cause when I'm missing you
I'll stop eating food
And I'll squeeze into a dress
So I can be like you
And then I'll see your bitterness
And why you're leaving too
Maybe, I'll put you to a test
And say that I love you
I think that I love you
Take me back to live at home
Take me back to Albert Road
Now, I'm missing you
'Cause when I'm missing you
I'll stop eating food
And I'll squeeze into your dress
So I can feel like you
But then I saw your bitterness
And then I'll see your bitterness
And why you left me too
I thought I'd put you to a test
And say that I love you
I think that I love you
And I'll stop eating food
And I'll squeeze into your dress
So I can feel like you
But then I saw your bitterness
And then I'll see your bitterness
And why you left me too
I thought I put you to a test
And say that I love you
Now it seems you loved me too
This city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when it's late
Sirens bleed through my windowsill
I can't close my eyes
Don't control what I'm into
This tower is alive
The lights that blind keep me awake
My hood up and lace untied
Sleep fills my mind
Don't control what I'm into
London calls me a stranger
A traveler
This is now my home, my home
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two
The pavement is my friend
Hey, and it will take me where I need to go
I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what I'm used to
The shop across the road
Fulfills my needs and gives me company
When I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I don't think I'm gonna make it
Past tomorrow
London calls me a stranger
A traveler
This is now my home, my home
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two
And my lungs hurt
And my ears bled
With the sound of the city life
Echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts
But I need to move along
I'm from a city where the rain won't sleep
Pollution in the air matches that on the street
The black smoke
Gets your head into a muddle like
Walking into elephants
Syringes in a puddle like
I was a country boy when I moved out
Grew up too fast for my family to find out
Now I try to stop my music running into nose dives
Can't resort to arrogance
With white lies
This city wants to raise me
But I can't help but see just
How this dark city changed me
It's all the same see
Music is my life but
Now I try to fight
Whatever I need to hide from
North, South, East, West
London's my home now
Knees weak but we never slow down
Now I start to do my music properly
I'll stay away from all the negative shit
That will follow me
London calls me a stranger
This is not my home, home
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two
You’re not her
Though I try to see you differently
I tow the line
You see, I’m searching for what used to be mine
I saw your eyes
And then I saw her staring back at me
And I will try to find another one
Who suited me as well as her
I've moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren’t clear
When we never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I’d miss you
I miss you
She was mine
I was hers
And all that’s in between
If she would cry
I would shelter her
And keep her from the darkness that will be
If I moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren’t clear
We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I’d miss you
And I miss you
Don’t drop me in
It’s not my turn
If you cut deep
Then I might learn
If you scar and leave me
Like a sunburn
Don’t drop me in
It’s not my turn
If you cut deep
Then I might learn
You scarred and left me
Like a sunburn
We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I’d miss you
I miss you
White lips, pale face
Breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eye
And hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
They scream
The worst things in life come free to us
And we're all under the upper hand
Go mad for a couple grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
To fly, fly
For angels to fly, to fly, to fly
For angels to die
Mmm...
Whoa oh...

Could I wake up next to you
When it's hitting double figures
Look into your eyes
Like I'm looking into double mirrors
Could you make it any clearer
Everything's such a blur
It's not my turn
It's hers to get hurt
On a late night
Coming home from way too many train rides
Lace not as red as my face
I'm home at the same time
Highbury estate's fine
Smoking like a dragon, but don't chase lines
Hey....
I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired, at quarter to three AM
I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my meals for free
I think I'm being shunned by my feet again
'Cause it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me yeah...
And now I'm sitting on a night bus
Flicking through my iPod
Feeling kinda tired
So I try to close my eyes up
Driver, turn the lights off
Lights on, on stage, mics on
Song plays, nice one
Gotta keep my hype strong
Truth be, never went to Uni
People see right through me
but I'm not a fool, see
I'm never gonna do one
Gonna live past 22, done
Everything I need to
Except get a 2:1
I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired, at quarter to three AM
I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my meals for free
Think I'm being shunned by my feet again
'Cause it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me yeah...
When I feel cold
You keep me warm
And I'm not looking for some loose change
Just wanna find a true mate
Who wants to be my duvet hey-eh
It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me Yeah...mm..oh.
If we take this bird in
With its broken leg
We could nurse it
She said
Come inside
For a little lie down with me
If you fall asleep
It wouldn’t be the worst thing
But when I wake up
Your make-up is on my shoulder
And tell me, if I lie down
Would you stay now
And let me hold you?
But if I kissed you
Will your mouth read this truth?
Darling, how I miss you
Strawberries taste how lips do
And it’s not complete yet
Mustn’t get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret
Diving in too soon
And I’ll owe it all to you
My little bird
My little bird
If we take a walk out
In the morning dew
We could lay down
So I’m next to you
Come inside
For a little home-made tea
If you fall asleep
Then at least you’re next to me
And if I wake up
You see, it’s late, love
Go back to sleep
I’m covered by nature
And I’m safe now
Underneath this oak tree
With you beside me
But if I kissed you
Will your mouth read this truth?
Darling, how I miss you
Strawberries taste how lips do
And it’s not complete yet
Mustn’t get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret
Diving in too soon
And I’ll owe it all to you
My little bird
My little bird
My little bird
My little bird
And of all these things
I’m sure of
I’m not quite certain
Of your love
And you made me scream
But then I made you cry
When I left that little bird
With its broken leg to die
But if I kissed you
Will your mouth read this truth?
Darling, how I miss you
Strawberries taste how lips do
And it’s not complete yet
Mustn’t get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret
Diving in too soon
But I’ll owe it all to you
My little bird
My little bird whoa oh oh
My little bird
My little bird
You’re my little bird
She's reinventing loving me
When we're resembling cutlery
On the sofa
It must have been
About 5:01
Like my blue ripped jeans
And my eyes are closed
And I'm way too tired
Hoody still smells of the beach bonfire
On the sofa, where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day
And it's cold outside again
And we're both so high
We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want
Say the word and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa
On the sofa with you
When the morning comes
We're not watching Formula One
It's not what we breathe for
So kick off the day with Friends on T4
Two, boiled and brew
Two sugars ain't too sweet for you
On the sofa, where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day
And it's cold outside, again
And we're still so high
We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want
Say the word and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa
On the sofa with you
And it feels like I'm flying
And it feels like
We could go to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
Through the streets of New York
That is where I will take ya
Paris, Rome, to Rio
Passing through Las Vegas
We can go where you want
Say the word, and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa
On the sofa
On the sofa, with you
Lying in a bedroom
Lighting up a Benson
Face hair is growing
So I cut it with a vengeance
Hey, did I mention
As she makes an entrance
Said I had a tendency
To finish off a sentence
Oh well, she’s a local girl
No make-up
Cause she knows me well
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek
For her one-night man
Is it fast food?
I’ll regret it after
And I needed money
But I’m too shy to ask her
So she buys me chips and cheese
And I tell her that I love her
And she’s all I need
I take it with a cold glass
Of the fruit and the barley
She’s still a sucker for the
Apple and Bacardi
Heading to the party
Sitting in the car seat
B.E.P. on radio
It makes me feel naughty and lastly
She knows me well
Bit of a catch
To have a local girl
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek
For her one-night man
I don’t wanna go alone
I don’t wanna go alone
No, I don't wanna go alone
Tell her that I love her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I want her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don’t, I’ll tell her myself
And we’ve got that love in us
So if the drink kill us
We’re gonna dance all night
Till the floor fillers
If we talk outside
Say I hate wasps too
I don’t really dance
So I’ll just watch you
Are you taking me back tonight?
Tell me if that’s alright
I don’t wanna be here
I’m not the sofa type
Tell me if you have a toothbrush
You don’t mind sharing
She said I wanna take off
What you’re wearing
And I don’t wanna go alone
I don’t wanna go alone
I don’t wanna go alone, oh.
Tell her that I love her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I want her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don’t, I’ll tell her myself
She’s like the fast food
I’ll regret it after
And I needed money
But I’m too shy to ask her
But she buys me chips and cheese
So I tell her that she’s all I need
Tell her that I
Tell her that I
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I
Tell her that I
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don’t, I’ll tell her myself
Now tell her that I love her
Tell her that I need her
That she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I want her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don’t, I’ll tell her myself
I fell in love next to you
Burning fires in this room
It just fits
Light and smooth
Like my feet in my shoes
Little one, lie with me
Sew your heart to my sleeve
We'll stay quiet
Underneath shooting stars
If it helps you sleep
And hold me tight
Don't let me breathe
Feeling like
You won't believe
There's a firefly
Loose tonight
Better catch it
Before it burns this place down
And I lie
If I don't feel so right
But the world looks better
Through your eyes
Teach my skin
Those new tricks
Warm me up
With your lips
Heart to heart
Melt me down
It's too cold
In this town
Close your eyes
Lean on me
Face to mouth
Lips to cheek
Feeling numb
In my feet
You're the one
To help me get to sleep
And hold me tight
Don't let me breathe
Feeling like
You won't believe
There's a firefly
Loose tonight
Better catch it
Before it burns this place down
And I lie
If I don't feel so right
But the world looks better
Through your eyes
It's only been
One night of love
And maybe
That is not enough
Hold me tight
Don't let me breathe
Feeling like
You won't believe
It's only been
One night of love
And maybe
That is not enough
Hold me tight
Don't let me breathe
Feeling like
You won't believe
There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it
Before it burns this place down
And I lie
If I don't feel so right
But the world looks better
Through your eyes
This city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when it's late
Sirens bleed through my windowsill
I can't close my eyes
Don't control what I'm into
This tower is alive
The lights that blind keep me awake
With my hood up and lace untied
Sleep fills my mind
Don't control what I'm into
London calls me a stranger

The traffic stops and starts
But I need to move along
I'm from a city where the rain won't cease
Pollution in the air matches that on the street
The black smoke gets your head into a muddle, like
Walking into elephant syringes in the puddle, like
I was a country boy when I moved out
Grew up too fast for my family to find out
Now I try to stop my music running into nosedives
Can't resort to arrogance with white lies
This city won't erase me
But I can't help to see how this dark city changed me
It's all the same scene, music is my life
But now I try to fight whatever I need to hide from
North, South, East, West, London's my home now
Knees weak, but we never slow down
Now I start to do my music properly
And stay away from all the negative shit that will follow me
London calls me a stranger
This is not my home, home
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two
She's like cold coffee in the morning
I'm drunk off last nights whisky and coke
She'll make me shiver without warning
And make me laugh as if I'm in on the joke
And you can stay with me forever
Or you could stay with me for now
Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to
I'll wake with coffee in the morning
But she prefers two lumps of sugar and tea
Outside the day is up and calling
But I don't have to be so, please go back to sleep
Stay with me forever
Or you could stay with me for now
Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to
'Cause I love the way you wake me up
For goodness sake will my love not be enough?
Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to
Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
I paid all my dues
And she wanted to know
That I'd never leave her
Now I'm ready to go
And strange as it seems
She's endless to me
She's just like paperwork
But harder to read
Patience, my enemy
And loving's my friend
It's harder to leave
With my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
I made all my plans
And she has made hers
She kept me in mind
But I wasn't sure
I searched every room
For a way to escape
But every time
I tried to leave
She keeps holding on to me
For dear life
And blocking my way
Patience, my enemy
And loving's my friend
It's harder to leave
With my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
And like the back of her hand
She already understands everything
Won't you stay?
She says
And she already knows how it goes
And where she stands
I'll stay, anyway
Cos she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
I know myself
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
I know myself
I know myself
I know myself
Treat me beneath this clear night sky
And I will lie with you
I start to feel those butterflies
When I'm next to you
Tell me your secrets
Give me a friend
Let all the good times flood in
Do I love you?
Do I hate you?
I can't make up my mind
So let's freefall
See where we land
It's been this way since we were young
We'll fight and then make up
I'll breathe your air into my lungs
When I feel your touch
Tell me your secrets
Give me a friend
Let all the good times flood in
Do I love you?
Do I hate you?
I can't make up my mind
So let's freefall
And see where we land
Tada ra ra
Tada ra ra
Tada ra ra
Tell me your secrets
Give me a friend
Let all the good times flood in
Do I love you?
Do I hate you?
I can't make up my mind
So let's freefall
And see where we land
I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be
Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees
Admiring the scene, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe.
Jet-lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep
Although my blood shot whites and irises they never find any
Clock stops at times where the sunshine can blind many
Although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon
'Cause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose it's true
We make corrosive tunes through acid tabs and vocables
To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves
I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme
So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine
'Cause real will recognise real is what my father says
And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away
Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow
But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close.
5 o'clock with lights off
Interview with a vampire
Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require
I swear I said, that I'll sleep when I'm dead
Who's on the beat upon the feature with Ed, it's D-E-V to the Z
Overtired, pale-faced like Michael Myers
Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage I've acquired
And over the time within this maze I'll think you'll find you'll never find that piece of mind you seek to find until your dying
'Cause I got too much to stay awake for, to sleep or even take 4, seconds out the game
It's time to wage war
Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives
2 psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight
I'm haling from the Essex and the East London boarder line
Villains never sleep the mastermind in all sorts of crimes,
Be wide awake just like your snorting lines
Or get left mortified like you've just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free, it could be,
The times I'm living in I never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from my restless Mind for free, it could be...
The times I'm living in lately.
I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth
And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out
Deliver the raps how I flow
I live with the raps now and those that hate me call me Ron
But they won't Slytherin too easy, believe me I'm Snape minded
Be within this great time, be on minimum wage, life is a prison escape that I'm in
It's all to do with timing not the label that you sign with
Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in
I try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows
Some of the the songs I write are real because the chart is filled with si-lo-con
I'm still broke without the money for a Mac Pro, living out of three bags no talk About my cash flow
Opposite of sober cause I never did my homework
Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older
I played a fool to catch the wise I will never tell a lie
Await death, take deep breaths, try to never die.
Never die.
2 guys with the same view, keep it tight like screws
Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes
And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze,
Times elapsing while your catching Z's, the masses like to move
We scan the situation, analyse information, and then decide what probably is most Practical to do,
Driven young gentlemen
I've hardly changed my bed sheets at all over the last 12 months 'causeI haven't Slept in them, true!
I'm coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong so I'm correcting 'em
We got the fans all like 'Oh wow it's Devs and Ed' what less did you bloody expect From 'em
In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment
Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock and no way will I ever Waste a second of the time I got,
I keep my pupils engaged,
Like a classroom in holy matrimony but I'm only trying to stay awake.
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free, it could be,
The times I'm living in I never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from my restless Mind for free, it could be... [x4]
The times I'm living in lately.
These thoughts I have could be clear ones and they can seem vivid
the goals I reach are not near ones the further than limits
I block her out so when I'm looking through my mind she ain't in it
Can I be free for a minute, can I be me for a minute?
The thoughts I have can be dark ones, even be smart ones
Know I'm gonna have a couple straight from the heart ones
Tell you what I think I will until I depart mum
It's you that I lived for, I am the first and the last one to love you lots
Whats better than thinking about the ones you love
Nothing much when you're thinking about the ones you love
I feel the same when I'm in the floor, see the sun above
Unconditional like bills paid when I run them up
No one here to help you pain now you're gonna moan
No one here to save the day now you're all alone
Wish I was born with a golden spoon in my mouth
Fact is I wasn't so, I'm coming from a colder zone
And when the sun falls down I'll be up again
I never close my eyes,
And if the dawn might break I'll see nothing when (nothing when)
My thoughts are only you and my mind is over you
My thoughts are over you and these words are all for you (all for you)
I wanna see you happy, I wanna see you smile
Cause you're been trespassing, and you won't leave my mind
Now even think about this, call me say, yes nan
I'm 31 now I'm still saying yes nan
You had to replace my mom, dad 2 parents in one
I know your proud staring at your grandson
I found a job I like like, got the flat, the cars, the bike, the quad I like
Because of you I'm tireless in every single song I write
Had a golden life, wanting people to honour mine
Tell 'em while I'm here, cause one day I'm gonna die
And when I'm I'm gone I want my music still playin'
And when my people listen to this track, it's gonna make them wanna cry
I ain't gonna lie, I think about my scene to say the games better is a must now I gotta fly
My talents gonna shine for surely, fam I know it, I work 'round the clock, I don't stop at night.
And when the sun falls down I'll be up again
I never close my eyes,
And if the dawn might break I'll see nothing when (nothing when)
My thoughts are only you and my mind is over you
My thoughts are over you and these words are all for you (all for you)
My thoughts are only you and my mind is over you
My thoughts are over you and these words are all for you (all for you).
Hi, my name is JME, there was a time when radio played me
Cause my music came from my heart, it was real to me
But now it's a par
I'm here struggling, keeping it real, while the rest of them are hustling, seeking a deal,
Sometimes I sit back and think JME just do one tune, make a couple G's and chill,
The reason I started making music is the exact same reason that I'll never do it, I swear
I didn't go through all that for this
I'll give that a miss, that's just how it is, unfair, straight Who could tell me different, look at me, determined,
Man on a mission, my music is me, and I am my music
So like it or lump it, I'm a do this
I never had a playlist in my heart, oho
Now I need an A list just to chart oho
But I've been famous from the start oho
How am I gonna make my mark? oho oh
Are you gonna play me, though, this song was never meant for the radio
I get in, forget the radio spin, I'm just doing my thing, and I don't have time for a playlist
How much will you pay me though? The song was not a hit on the radio, oho, oho, oho, oh, oh, oh
Thank God for night clubs and the raves
Cause I don't think they like us on the airwaves
Unless we water it down, but cordial music is boring me now
I swear, I guess it matters what your goal is
Or in this music scene, what your role is
I'm still trying here, cause I'm a pioneer
I use my mouth less than I use my eyes and ears
See I'm just telling you the truth
Can't shoot the messenger, bullet proof booth,
You won't hear me on the radio, but go to the rave and the crowd, they're raising roof
Why is that? What's going on there?
To tell you the truth, I don't really care
I am my music, my music is me
Like it or not, this is how it's gonna be
I never had a playlist in my heart, oho
Now I need an A list just to chart oho
But I've been famous from the start oho
How am I gonna make my mark oho
Are you gonna play me, though, this song was never meant for the radio
I get in forget the radio spin, I'm just doing my thing, and I don't have time for a playlist
How much will you pay me though? The song was not a hit on the radio, oho, oho, oho, oh, oho, oh
I feel it on the airwave, spinning on the dial
Bleeding through the speakers, rhythm by the pile,
So won't you hear me out?
Never feel it from the base line, feel it in the club
Maybe I could take time singing for the dub
So won't you hear me out?
Are you gonna play me, though, this song was never meant for the radio
I get in forget the radio spin, I'm just doing my thing, and I don't have time for a playlist
How much will you pay me though? The song was not a hit on the radio, oho, oho, oho, oh
Are you gonna play me, though, this song was never meant for the radio
I get in forget the radio spin, I'm just doing my thing, and I don't have time for a playlist
How much will you pay me though? The song was not a hit on the radio, oho, oho, oho, oh.
Little lady, this is just the worst way to spend your birthday
It's 30 degrees, Thursday
You work late, you was with a perv making dirty fake love in his Mercedes
Lady, the word 'rape' sums up events that take place every night
You wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try
And you remember that your punter went crazy last night
You drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry
Forget the visit to the clinic you were booked in for
You'll make a trip to the Whittington where they'll look at your jaw
They'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure
They'll know you're fibbing if you tell them you got hit by a door
But young woman
The pimp sees you as nothing but a dumb hooker
Medical attention could be fatal
'Cause the cunt wouldn't ever let a doctor near someone that's getting dough for him
'Cause next you got poxy authorities sticking their noses in
She's just under the upper hand
And goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside, tonight.
'Cause in the pipe she'll fly to the motherland and
Sell love to another man
It's too cold outside, for angels to fly.
For angels to fly.
Little lady, your mind you've made up
Your injuries you can't hide with make-up
You need some medical advice, you make up
A little lie to say just
In case the doc opens his eyes and don't decide to play dumb
With any luck you'll see the same dude who stitched your top lip
Last year when your pimp just lost it
He wouldn't recognise you if you stared him in the face anyway
'Cause all the heroin is making you age
But you're a heroine for taking the strain of being a prostitute and punching bag
The funds you have left go where you're from using Moneygram
Mother had to get you out the motherland to study
That was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand
Little does she know you're never coming back
She put you in her brother's hand only for him to formulate another plan
He's the fucking cause of your appalling state this summer
Fancy that, you came to London to get pimped by your Uncle, damn.
She's just under the upper hand
Goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside, tonight.
'Cause in the pipe she'll fly to the motherland and
Sell love to another man
It's too cold outside, for angels to fly
Now an angel will die, covered in white
With closed eyes and hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight,
Straight down the line.
Little lady, you're trembling with fear
Your skinny frame kinda resembles a deer
You're sitting facing the detective, oh dear
The meddling nurse couldn't just leave it,
She's only gone and made it much worse calling police in
She'll never know the gravity of the damage she's caused
You're causing scandal going mad in the ward now
The cop is trying to calm you, telling you he won't let no one harm you
The same question he keeps trying to ask you, 'Who you working for?'
He's talking to you like you're worth more than a dirty whore
You're having a conversation you could be murdered for
You're learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court
It's kicking knowledge you ain't ever heard before
Just before he leaves, he reassures you that he knows that it's hard
He underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card
Begs you to use it
He's useless if you're gonna be stupid
'Cause an answer hasn't come from your bruised lips, you're on your own
You've gotta go and give your pimp what you owe
You reach your door and then it dawns that you've been followed home
Before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat
And then a voice says, 'Where you been bitch? I wanna know.'
No prizes for guessing who it is, resistance would be foolishness
You open the front door, he boots you in
There's something new in him, he's silent now that fills you with terror
Get your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error
He towers over you, the 6 inch knife catches the sunlight
At this point your life flashes before your eyes
Your handbag's dropped and all the contents are all over the floor
Despite the mess there's only one thing that's caught his eye
And in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece
And dumps her body in the boot of his Merc in the street.
Little lady left this earth in the worst way
All because she got a card on her 13th birthday
And we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And we don't wanna go outside, tonight.
'Cause in the pipe she'll fly to the motherland and
Sell love to another man.
It's too cold outside, for angels to fly, for angels to fly, and fly fly,
For angels to fly, to fly, to fly, angels to die
I’m in so deep Omar Epps can relate to my situation on a real,
Pain ain’t the emotion I wanna feel but I’m thriving off it so it's only right, I like this topic
I’ll be on a hill, keeping my head above water
I can’t afford to ever get caught in a corner
So I move with the force of a sorcerer
It’s dark when I’m about just me myself and my shadow
I'm parro, running out of ammo, and it seems like everyone around me is on the same path so it’s narrow
The less then the better, a more proof for the last one left so they don't leave me as wet as an umbrella
I play fool to catch wise are they ever gonna guess I'm clever
How can I be at my best with this pressure
I got a lot to loose but when I watch the news my mind’s infected with terror
No wonder I’m under stress, I got my door kicked off by a bunch of feds
And when they left It looked like I had rave and invited more than a hundred guests
I should of bust the back door and jump the fence
It easy when you look back, shoulda, woulda, coulda but I bet you can’t bring should woulda could back
Back to fifteen I said to myself, that I’m more than a hood track!
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you will never drown me out
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you will never drown me out, out, out
You won’t drown me out, out, out
You won’t drown me out
You can’t ever drown me out, the water supplies too low
And I'm around about 6'1, 10 stone
I've never seen someone drown without, a sufficient amount of liquid in their lungs
A violent MC, my mouth can vouch
Do I sound like I’m choking? Seriously, do I sound like I’m joking?
I’m floating, even though that they wanna send me to the bottom of the ocean
But I am a ship that's sunk many years, I’m maintaining
Plain sailing, no commotion
Like a dolphin, when it’s in motion
But i can't break me, so why would I show them I’m broken
No real shit, throw my skin ain’t close to corrosion
Fuck em all, this ain't tug of war, still don't get roped in the open, I don’t wanna reveal my violent side
But I swear that I will soon if the Lord above don't provide a sign
Then I’ma kill you, arm for arm, eye for eye
Nah, I just wanna live my life, but you don’t wanna see this guy survive.
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you will never drown me out
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you will never drown me out, out, out
You won’t drown me out
You won’t drown me out
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you will never drown me out
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you will never drown me out, out, out
You won’t drown me out
You won’t drown me out.
They tell me you can only dream when you fell asleep
But now I'm working to achieve, but sleep is the only thing I never see
And I vowed that my breathing will never cease
To the retrieve then I can't let them be
I won't let 'em leave and I had the same feeling since 17
But I wasn't ready then like a lemon's green
Now I'm in the magazines almost every week,
Cause I'm getting heat like in Tenerife,
Right now it's better than it's ever been
Never fade like a plant that's evergreen
It's what I hoped in my heart, but my self doubts are getting me,
Faith in my crafts getting dark by the day and I'm getting weak,
Cause I'm new, I'm not where the stars be.
They chase dreams together like a slumber party,
And now I'm on my own, even though I'm smooth sailing
I'm scared to sing, cause my nightmares'll fade in.
When the darkness creeps in,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
And when my dreams are sleeping,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
Oh, oh, oh!
I feel my nightmares watching me.
You better wake up cause I am making moves,
And even when I'm dozing I'm breaking rules,
I'm only hitting the sack when I'm training,
Too busy trying to keep up with the latest snooze.
Made my bed and that's where I'm heading,
I fly straight with the best man I embed 'em
Married to the game was a quiet wedding, then I had to fight to get her
Now I'm taking control of my inception,
Cause they try to hit my misses with my erection,
See they better marry donna cause when I strike, strike,
Not even Argentina's gonna cry for them.
See I'm awake at night, with the ammunish
The haters know where the family lives.
Anyone I catch playing knock down ginger,
Is gonna lose a lot more, than I need it.
They say sleep is the cousin of death,
But I hear shit, cousin I am deaf
Gang signs I'm a N/A reading.
I'm a CEO, man you suckers are next.
When the darkness creeps in,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
And when my dreams are sleeping,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
Oh, oh, oh!
I feel my nightmares watching me.
They watching me! They watch me sleep!
Let me go!
I fell asleep on sofa, woke up in reality,
And daydream about losing my sanity.
I've been rhyming forever got a blind flow.
So I can see an off note with my eyes closed.
But to achieve your dreams you can't doze off cause you dream a sleep
I ain't nodding off but I'm nodding to the beat.
I be shocking in my sheets, when I should have been asleep.
See, all the dreams I'm fond of,
You placed me in the team insomnia
Now, I'm Mr hard worker,
In my nightmares I'm Mr can't turn up,
And I missed my chance worst luck,
Trying to hit women like Mr Ike Turner
Ch'yeah, but I walked from that ish,
Now they gotta put me to rest, mattress.
When the darkness creeps in,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
And when my dreams are sleeping,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
Oh, oh, oh!
I feel my nightmares watching me.
Watching me!
Hey... Can you hear me?
I just wanted to let you know...
Hmm...

I hope you can hear what I write to you
How could I say goodbye to you?
When I'm a life that came out of the inside of a life that was inside of you
I gotta respect the way you provided food, for the whole fam
You came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man
Cold double 8, 8 kids bare wheels
Plus racists full of hatred in your own plant
3 jobs in a day
Rest in life in you working but you were never stress free
Just locked in a cage slaving
They said they were gold in the pavements
But you came and saw the road to amazement
Broke your heart
But still you were prone to last and your sorrow was over fast
I hope your listening right
I still think of you every Sunday
No one can top your chicken and rice
Even through the darkness times
You held us all up because your vision was bright
I knew your strength was your wisdom inside
You never let anyone see your heartache
You just got on with it
Anyone tells me that they knew you said you were beautiful
And your words you would stand strong with it
Cause they were like warmth on a winter night
But I was just too young to go on with it
And there somethings I could try to do
But it's an impossible task for me to even try to say goodbye to you
I couldn't do that, I owe my life to you.

And of the pieces of my soul...
(Because I need a sign, I hope this pain will heal in time...)
You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one...

I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh...

I think you phoney
I was younger with the knowledge of things that I know now
I would be by your side when you needed me
Instead of asking you 'Nan can I go out? '
Standing in a road with the gangs that I know now
Everyone's missing you loads, Jessica's grown up
Warreen, Lauren and Alex are fine and I'm living with hope
It's been a while since I've seen C and the mouths
I miss seeing a family, being a family
And us agreeing with smiles how it used to be as a child
But as time goes by, the bridge seems longer
Family problems have never been funny
In my heart the only one that dissed me was Sonia
She took all our inheritance money
Left the rest of us to pick up the pieces
I never forgive the way she betrayed us.
There ain't a big enough reason
Before I sell out my fam I'll be giving up breathing
But I guess that everyone's different
Or should I say no one's perfect?
She had happiness in front of her
But chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing.
Since you gone the foundations crumbled
So building it back up is my next step
I got all the bricks and the cement but
It's hard when it's done, I don't know what to expect
So give me the strength that I need to perform this task
Make it right, I must do
And I ask cause I trust you
It goes way beyond a song when I say I love you.
And of the pieces of my soul...
(Because I need a sign I hope this pain will heal in time...)
You know I never wanna be alo-oh-oh-one...
I can see the stars as a cold the wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh...
It's just for now so I should hush...
I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but,
I miss you... Ohh how I miss you...
It's just for now so I should hush...
I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but,
I miss you... Ohh how I miss you...
There ain't enough words to describe
How sorry I am for the pain that I caused
Sorry for when I stuck up my own blood
We were young and he said it was rapeing his broad
And for the day police came to the door
I'm sorry for being such a bad youth
Stealing from your purse and making you mourn
I never been able to say this before
Cause I was so inconsiderate
You loved me unconditionally
And I took advantage of it like a idiot.
Not seeing the pure soul that I was living with
I really hope that you can forgive me
You going away was a punishment
But I won't let go I'm holding you with me
But I still fight the emotions within me.
I can see the stars as the cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
And can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down your face,
Feel the chill of your warm embrace?
And can I say goodbye to you?
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air,
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you...?
I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And never an excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me,
It never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your make up
Lips sticks to me, so now I maybe lean back there
I'm sat here wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to
But a house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold I'll be freezing
Can't rely on my heart to beat in
'Cause you take parts of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like 'when you leaving me? '
Should I? Should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again, I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love
I wanna hold your heart in both hands
Not watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can
And I got no plans for the weekend, so should we speak then?
Keep it between friends
Though I know you'll never love me like you used to
There may be other people like us
Who see the flicker of a clipper when they light up
Flames just create us but burns don't heal like before
And you don't hold me anymore
On cold days cold plays out like the band's name
I know I can't heal things with a handshake
You know I can change, as I began saying
You cut me wide open like landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make
Should I? Should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again, I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love
All by myself, I'm here again
All by myself, you know I'll never change
All by myself
All by myself
I'm just drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love
I found your hair band on my bedroom floor
The only evidence that you'd been here before
And I don't get waves of missing you anymore
They're more like tsunami tides
In my eyes
Never getting dry,
So I get high,
Smoke away the days, never sleep with the light on
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye
And I'm still drunk at the end of the night
I don't drink like everybody else
I do it to forget things about myself
Stumble and fall
With the head spin I got,
My mind's with you but my heart's just not
So am I close to you anymore if it's over?
And there's no chance that we'll work it out
That's why you and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied
Everybody said we'd be together forever,
But I know that I never wanna settle down,
Come around, break up the love like Lego now
Never wanna turn into another like you
Sleep with my thoughts
And I dance with my views
Everything's great, not everything's sure,
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus
Now I'm in a position to be another stalker
Like everything I say seems to all sound awkward
Like our last kiss. It was perfect,
But we were nervous on the surface
And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it,
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts
I forget like an elephant
Or we can use a sedative
And go back to the day we fell in love just on our first kiss
So am I close to you anymore if it's over?
And there's no chance that we'll work it out
You and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied
Wo-ooooahhhh oohh ohh
Because if I was gonna go somewhere,
I'd be there by now
And maybe I can let myself down
And I'm thinking that I'm unaware,
I keep my feet on the ground
And keep looking around
To make sure I'm not the only one to feel low
Because if you want,
I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered
From all that I've done wrong
And I know you'll say
That I'm the only one,
But I know God made another one of me to love you better than I ever will
'Cause you and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied
My mind is a warrior,
My heart is a foreigner,
My eyes are the colour of red like a sunset,
I'll never keep it bottled up
And left to the hands of the coroner,
Be a true heart not a follower,
We're not done yet.
And I see it in your movements tonight,
If we should ever do this right,
I'm never gonna let you down,
Oh I'll never let you down,
Now keep it on the down low
And I'll keep you around so I'll know
That I'll never let you down,
I'll never let you down.
You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I've never felt this way,
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down,
Now you're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I've never felt this way,
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down,
Now, my eyes are a river filler,
This drink is a liver killer,
My chest is a pillow for your weary head to lay to rest again,
Your body is my ballpoint pen
And your mind is my new best friend,
Your eyes are the mirror to take me to the edge again,
Now I see it in your movements tonight,
If we should ever do this right,
I'm never gonna let you down,
Oh I'll never let you down,
We'll keep it on the down low
And I'll keep you around so I'll know
That I'll never let you down,
I'll never let you down,
You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I've never felt this way,
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down,
You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I've never felt this way,
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down,
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now, and I'll never let you down
'Cause You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I've never felt this way,
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down,
You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I've never felt this way,
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down.
I should ink my skin with your name
And take my passport out again
And just replace it
See I could do without a tan
On my left hand,
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
And I should run you a hot bath
And fill it up with bubbles
'Cause maybe you're lovable
And maybe you're my snowflake
When your eyes turn from green to gray
In the winter I'll hold you in a cold place
And you should never cut your hair
'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder
And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up
And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me?
Could you make me a cup of tea to open my eyes in the right way?
And I know you love Shrek
'Cause we've watched it 12 times
But maybe you're hoping for a fairy tale too
And if your DVD breaks today
You should've got a VCR
Because I've never owned a Blu-ray, true say
And now I've always been shit at computer games
And your brother always beats me
And if I lost, I'd go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV
And then you'd laugh at me
And be asking me
If I'm gonna be home next week
And then you'd lie with me 'til I fall asleep
And flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets
And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up
And I think you hate the smell of smoke
You always try get me to stop
But you drink as much as me
And I get drunk a lot
So I'll take you to the beach
And walk along the sand
And I'll make you a heart pendant
With a pebble held in my hand
And I'll carve it like a necklace
So the heart falls where your chest is
And now a piece of me is a piece of the beach
And it falls just where it needs to be
And rests peacefully
So you just need to breathe
To feel my heart against yours now, against yours now
'Cause maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Or maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up
You're just a small bump unborn
In four months you're brought to life
You might be left with my hair
But you'll have your mother's eyes
I'll hold your body in my hands
Be as gentle as I can
But for now you're a scan of my unmade plans
A small bump
In four months you're brought to life
I'll whisper quietly
I'll give you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb and hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be alright
Oh, you're just a small bump unknown
You'll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers
And a dimple beneath your chin
Fingernails the size
Of a half grain of rice
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide
A small bump
In four months you'll open your eyes
And I'll hold you tightly
I'll tell you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb and hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be alright
And you can lie with me
With your tiny feet
When you're half asleep
I'll leave you be
Right in front of me
For a couple weeks
So I can keep you safe
'Cause you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb and hold me tight
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be alright
'Cause you were just a small bump unborn
For four months then torn from life
Maybe you were needed up there
But we're still unaware as why
This is the start of something beautiful
This is the start of something new
You are the one who'd make me lose it all
You are the start of something new, ooh
And I'll throw it all away
And watch you fall into my arms again
And I'll throw it all away
Watch you fall, now
You are the earth that I will stand upon
You are the words that I will sing
And I've thrown it all away
And watched you fall into his arms again
And I've thrown it all away
Watched you fall, now
And take me back
Take me home
Watch me fall
Down to earth
Take me back for
This is the start of something beautiful
You are the start of something new
This city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when it’s late
Sirens bleed through my windowsill
I can’t close my eyes
Don’t control what I’m into
And this tower is alive
The lights that blind keep me awake
Hood up and lace untied
The sleep fills my mind
Can't control what I’m into
London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home
I’m burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I’m blazing on the street
What I do isn’t up to you
If the city never sleeps
Then that makes two
The pavement is my friend
It will take me where I need to go
I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what I’m used to
The shop across the road
Fills my needs and gives me company
When I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I don’t think I’m gonna make it
Past tomorrow
London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home
I’m burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I’m blazing on the street
What I do isn’t up to you
If the city never sleeps
Then that makes two
And my lungs hurt
And my ears bled
With the sound of the city life
Echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts
But I need to move along
London calls me a stranger
This is not my home, home
I’m burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I’m blazing on the street
What I do isn’t up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two
I'm gonna pick up the pieces and build a Lego house
If things go wrong we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings but there's one thing on my mind
It's all for you
And it's dark in a cold December, but I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken I will mend ya and keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on, now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now, now
I'm gonna paint you by numbers and colour you in
If things go right we can frame it and put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it but I've been here before
Now I'll surrender up my heart and swap it for yours
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now
Don't hold me down, I think the braces are breaking and it's more than I can take
And it's dark in a cold December, but I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken I will mend ya and keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on, now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind,
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done, I will love you better now
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done I will love you better now
One, two, three, four
Settle down with me
Cover me up
Cuddle me in
Lie down with me
And hold me in your arms
And your heart's against my chest, your lips pressed to my neck
I'm falling for your eyes, but they don't know me yet
And with a feeling I'll forget, I'm in love now
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love
We're falling in love
Settle down with me
And I'll be your safety
You'll be my lady
I was made to keep your body warm
But I'm cold as the wind blows so hold me in your arms
Oh no
My heart's against your chest, your lips pressed to my neck
I'm falling for your eyes, but they don't know me yet
And with this feeling I'll forget, I'm in love now
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love
We're falling in love
Yeah I've been feeling everything
From hate to love
From love to lust
From lust to truth
I guess that's how I know you
So I hold you close to help you give it up
So kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love
We're falling in love
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love
We're falling in love
Give me love like her
'Cause lately I've been waking up alone
Paint splattered teardrops on my shirt
Told you I'd let them go
And that I'll fight my corner
Maybe tonight I'll call ya
After my blood turns into alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya
Give a little time to me or burn this out
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, give me love
Give me love like never before
'Cause lately I've been craving more
And it's been a while but I still feel the same
Maybe I should let you go
You know I'll fight my corner
And that tonight I'll call ya
After my blood is drowning in alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya
Give a little time to me or burn this out
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
Give a little time to me or burn this out
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
Of all the money that e'er I had
I've spent it in good company
And all the harm that e'er I've done
Alas it was to none but me
And all I've done for want of wit
To memory now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Of all the comrades that e'er I had
They are sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They would wish me one more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call
Good night and joy be with you all
A man may drink and not be drunk
A man may fight and not be slain
A man may court a pretty girl
And perhaps be welcomed back again
But since it has so ought to be
By a time to rise and a time to fall
Come fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Good night and joy be with you all
Another day, another life
Passes by just like mine
It's not complicated
Another mind, another soul
Another body to grow old
It's not complicated
Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?
Float down
Like autumn leaves
And hush now
Close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me
Another tear, another cry
Another place for us to die
It's not complicated
Another love that's gone to waste
Another light lost from your face
It's complicated
Is it that it's over or do birds still sing for you?
Float down
Like autumn leaves
And hush now
Close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me
Ooh how I miss you
My symphony played the song that carried you out
Ooh how I miss you
And I, I miss you and I wish you'd stay
Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?
Float down
Like autumn leaves
And hush now
Close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me
Ooh oh, ooh oh
Ooh oh, ooh oh
Touch down
Like a seven four seven
Stay out and we'll live forever 
If we take this bird in
With its broken leg
We could nurse it
She said
Come inside
For a little lie down with me
If you fall asleep
It wouldn’t be the worst thing
But when I wake up
Your make-up is on my shoulder
And tell me, if I lie down
Would you stay now
And let me hold you?
But if I kissed you
Will your mouth read this truth?
Darling, how I miss you
Strawberries taste how lips do
And it’s not complete yet
Mustn’t get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret
Diving in too soon
And I’ll owe it all to you
My little bird
My little bird
If we take a walk out
In the morning dew
We could lay down
So I’m next to you
Come inside
For a little home-made tea
If you fall asleep
Then at least you’re next to me
And if I wake up
You see, it’s late, love
Go back to sleep
I’m covered by nature
And I’m safe now
Underneath this oak tree
With you beside me
But if I kissed you
Will your mouth read this truth?
Darling, how I miss you
Strawberries taste how lips do
And it’s not complete yet
Mustn’t get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret
Diving in too soon
And I’ll owe it all to you
My little bird
My little bird
My little bird
My little bird
And of all these things
I’m sure of
I’m not quite certain
Of your love
And you made me scream
But then I made you cry
When I left that little bird
With its broken leg to die
But if I kissed you
Will your mouth read this truth?
Darling, how I miss you
Strawberries taste how lips do
And it’s not complete yet
Mustn’t get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret
Diving in too soon
But I’ll owe it all to you
My little bird
My little bird whoa oh oh
My little bird
My little bird
You’re my little bird
Smoke alarm went off at 9
I woke up, wiped the sleep out of my eyes
She left a note I'll be back in 5
Well, I'm still waiting for that moment to arrive, hey

I was told to put my job in front of you
But it won't hold me like you do

But I do it for the love
Waiting on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge
Smoking on a roll up
When I see my friends
All they say is Hold up
And remember the time
When we were in school
Listening to grown-ups.
Didn't learn a thing
But then again, you know what,
You know how to sing
But you don't know anything
Other than that.
So maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way...
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way...
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way...
And maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
You wanna be loved.
I never told her that I liked
The way she dances slightly out of time
And pretends she knows the words
To a song she's never heard
But I tell her all the time, hey
I was told to put my job in front of you
But it won't hold me like you do
But I do it for the love
Waiting on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge
Smoking on a roll up
When I see my friends
All they say is Hold up
And remember the time
When we were in school
Listening to grown-ups.
Didn't learn a thing
But then again, you know what,
You know how to sing
But you don't know anything
Other than that.
So maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way...
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way...
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way...
And maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
You wanna be loved, hey.
But I do it for the love
Waiting on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge
Smoking on a roll up
When I see my friends
All they say is Hold up
And remember the time
When we were in school
Listening to grown-ups.
Didn't learn a thing
But then again, you know what,
You know how to sing
But you don't know anything
Other than that.
So maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way...
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way...
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way...
And maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
You wanna be loved.
You’re not her
Though I try to see you differently
I tow the line
You see, I’m searching for what used to be mine
And I saw your eyes
And I saw Alice staring back at me
So I will try to find another one who suited me as well as her
I've moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren’t clear
When we never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I’d miss you
And I miss you
She was mine
I was hers and all that’s in between
If she would cry
I would shelter her and keep her from the darkness that will be
If I moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren’t clear
We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I’d miss you
And I miss you
Don’t drop me in
It’s not my turn
If you cut deep
Then I might learn
That you scarred and left me
Like a sunburn
Don’t drop me in
It’s not my turn
If you cut deep
Then I might learn
That you scar and leave me
Like a sunburn
We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I’d miss you
And I miss you
There wasn't much left
Except for the last twenty sack
And the last twenty of my last cheque
I took a pill and went to sleep on the last step
Woke up and took it in with a half breath
Then a deep sigh, I struck a matchstick
I lit my cigarette
Feeling half dead, whisky on my mind
Then came the dead
Sherrif in the yard, here comes the rest
I sat like a ghost, they all passed by
My girl cried baby this'll be my last bye
Baby in her arms
She took a cab home
She told me I was only good for a sad song
A crooked smile I gave
Nonchalant about it
Maybe she'll come back
This time I doubt it
Act like I care, but I really don't
Wanted to change
But somehow I knew I really won't
See I'm the type of man, who can't stay out the bottle
If the sun is out I'd rather be in the shadow
Sadness is like a wound that I can't heal
Maybe I'll love blood, I just let it spill
And I never turned to church for a pray in hand
God's not going to land another saving hand
If the time came like it has time again
Then I would watch the clock and be late again
One gun and a harley in the driveway
One way out, dirt road, pathway
Put another dead butt in the ash tray
I stand up still drunk, half baked
Cover my eyes from the bright morning sun blaring
And through the fence I can see this little boy staring
Paid him no attention
In fact I barely seen him
Until he walked away
And he started singing...
London Bridge is falling down, falling down
And if it don't stop falling, then all of us will drown
Then we'll crash, crash, right down again
Oh we'll crash, crash, right down again
I didn't see it coming
I didn't see the wall
And I went from running, to a slow crawl
I feel like I'm a child, but I'm afraid to cry
Would say I'm okay but I'm afraid to lie
I speak no evil, but hear no angels
A family is callin' but all I see is strangers
Take the bible from the hotel drawer
Hell froze over ice cold hell's door
Knock knock
I'm on the salt road non stop
The exit I will pass 'cause the sign did rot
And the gust of a dry summer
Dirty water in the tap
I think I found my number in the sand
Right next to an empty can
Old number seven, Jack is back again
And the voice goes round and round
And I would take the bridge
But I can't forget the sound
London Bridge is falling down, falling down
And if it don't stop falling, then all of us will drown
Then we'll crash, crash, right down again
Oh we'll crash, crash, right down again
I'll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rolling like a rock 'til I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can't be found
Only my God can track me down
And we'll crash, crash, right down again
Oh we'll crash, crash, right down again
I'll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rolling like a rock 'til I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can't be found
Only my God can track me down
I'll be coming up when the sun goes down
Living the life of a student, yeah, I begin on a high
Losing my mind and they say that I've been winning for time
Never been to a gun fight and never needed a knife
But then I make the cut whenever delivering lines
Sit on the side with a rhyme pad with a ten in my sights
Sipping a lemon and lime Corona only with my best friends
'Cause I've hidden my pride, giving the time
To write rhymes but I find truth at a quarter to five
Hey
It's kinda like I took a train to the left side of my brain, oh, mayne
Puddles of mud, under my love, you know I'm stepping in my own lane
All of these speakers sitting behind me
But what psychology, psychologically insane
Pardon me while I get down, down, down
Making you get up and say
If you don't know
If you don't know by now, you better tell him 'bout it
What you gonna tell him 'bout? Yeah
Yeah
Ten toes to the dirt, pencil to the paper
God has a favor for your thirst
Drink, drink a pint bye-bye
To this bullshit praise Allah
To the wheels, I'm a ridah, steel ring, no Prada
Only thrift clothes and my ada-di-das
I'm a fetus in my room, say na na
Daddy's home, on the mic, hey papa
Back with a bang yo, straight loop pedal, no band though
But every single one of my fans know
That every damn show I'm taking their ears on a journey
Like I'm flying overseas with Van Gogh
Livin' so sweet without Gretel and Hansel
Critics hate the lyrics 'cause they think I've been tangoed
Find me wearing old clothes, rocking a Kangol
I'm riding 'round with Yelawolf in your daddy's Lambo
Hello me, how ya been?
You got a mullet again like when you was 10
You're probably sipping sweet tea still, huh?
And your piggy bank is full of change
That what you used to steal from
You been playing fools like a steel drum
Pulling out early, and they still come
Eating from the game when you know the meal's done
Yelawolf is gettin' back at these pilgrims
Hold up baby, sit still, son, woah
This old rock, the hill's been rolled
Still shocking when I see 'em go
Bananas, when they handle this animalistic flow
If you don't know
If you don't know by now, you better tell him 'bout it
What you gonna tell him 'bout? Yeah
Yeah
I'm not the average half-a-wit after this hour gets out of this
60 seconds, I'm goin' any direction and
Chasing this Jack with a shot of Budweiser and water
Is probably the better idea, yeah, you move when the direction in
Fact, it's a part of me to be the looser of cannons
Blow on this fucking mic like a wind 'til college start again
Hooligans, hooligans rule again but really who's a friend?
Jump in this lake of fire, jump right back in the pool again
Knew I'd be new again, a student of you my friend
Marshall Mathers, I'm tossing rappers up at my crew of 10
Minus 4, minus war, you don't want it
Shady Records, I'm already better, fuck it, doggonnit
Dog don't gotta lead, dog's already home, Jack
Dogg I'm a beast, I'm a wolf, bring your dogs back (Woof !)
A melody-man and a melancholy mellow-yellow can
Shhhh, tell 'em how we gonna sell 'em man
Been working hard all week
So if you wonder if we earned it, well it's not a probably
So won't you bring that back to me
And holler when you hear it like all the screams of a Halloween
I got blisters on my feet
To walk at night with you, is not the shoes to be borrowing
So won't you bring that back to me
'Cause all the soul of my pen is only what all the sorrow brings
If you don't know
I'm out to bark again, ball cracked on the target, demolish it
Don't jump, I just see, nah, took a swattin', then
Think while I jump back on the beat, like I need audiences
To speak too like a leech, needs to retrieve blood
Should I creep into these ambient sounds with the speech? Obvious
Witness the retardedness with cerebral palsy, that's several pauses
You might need a coffin with holes on the top of these tubes to receive oxygen
You buried alive like a freak, six feet
Clawing and snatching and clawin' like a cat
And a dog and a rat
And a hog in a pen
With a frog and all there is to eat
Is frog and they
Beat each to a pulp with nails, teeth and jaws and then
They fight to the death for at least a piece off of them
See that you back to bars again, he's all asleep in coffin, man
I'm all, they all that's been, ever was at the start of it
You mention the squad and then
You mention the god of pens
Not of it, but I'm harder then
Flesh I'm harder than titanium brass plates that are polished in
Sticking emcees off like a fly trap, or a bobby pin
When I rap I'm astonishing
I attack tracks like a train track strapped to a bomb and send
Shockwave's that's what I made, got this bastard popping then
I spit on my pop's grave without apologin'
Take shits on shih tzus
Pisses on igloos
Throw it up to the whole fucking world, it's sick too
Vomitin' stomach fluid like you just ate shit stew
Did I say shit again? Do I give a shit, dude?
Neither does little Johnny give a shit if he sniffs glue
Or Beethoven care of you like his hair or the stick used
To orchestrate or does a porpoise hate when you dip through
Swimming in this ocean no, he just moves
What I'm trying to say is, it's my motherfucking ocean
And I crossed it
Built a bridge, the Slumdon Bridge, holla!
Tell me that you turned down the man
Who asks for your hand
'Cause you're waiting for me
And I know, you're gonna be away a while
But I've got no plans at all to leave
And would you take away my hopes and dreams and just stay with me?
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll never leave again
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one
Take my hand and my
Heart and soul, I will
Only have these eyes for you
And you know, everything changes, but
We'll be strangers if we see this through
You could stay within these walls and bleed or just stay with me
Oh, Lord, now
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one
Stumbling half drunk, getting myself lost
I am so gone, so tell me the way home
I listen to sad songs, singing about love
And where it goes wrong
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one
Oh I'm a mess right now
Inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender
But this is not the end
I can't work it out
How going through the motions
Going through us
And oh I've known it for the longest time
And all of my hopes
All of my own words
Are all over written on the signs
But you're on my road
Walking me home
See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna' feel your love
Easy baby maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight I wanna' fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach
I messed up this time
Late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion
With fingers intertwined
I can't shake this feeling now
We're going through the motions
Hoping you'd stop
And ohhh I've only caused you pain
I know but all of my words will always below
Of all the love you spoke
When you're on my road
Walking me home
See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna' feel your love
Easy baby maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight I wanna' fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach
And for how long, I love, my lover
For how long I love my lover
And now, now, for how long, long I love my lover
Now, now, for how long, long I love my lover
Ah lahmlahlah
Ah lahmlahlah
I met this girl late last year
She said, Don't you worry if I disappear.
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jump right in
A week later returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, I was never looking for a friend.
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10:00.
Baby, bring a lemon and a bottle of gin.
We'll be in between the sheets 'til the late AM.
Baby, if you wanted me then you should've just said.
She's singing
Ah lahmlahlah
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a take-away pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha
All over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane
Or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down
The way that things played out
When she was kissing him
How I was confused about
Now she should figure it out while I'm sat here singing
Ah lahmlahlah
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder
I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realize what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time God knows I'm singing
Ah lahmlahlah
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
I met you when I was a teen
But then you were one as well
And I could play a guitar
Just like ringing a bell
Sometimes I wonder
In any other summer
Could you have been my part-time lover to me
Listening to Stevie Wonder
Under the covers where we used to lay
And Re: Stacks is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day
When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay
Just watching a DVD, smoking illegal weed
Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe
We used each other's air just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We'd go anywhere our minds would take us
And I'll say you are beautiful without your make-up
And you don't even need to worry about your weight 'cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And time's the only reason that we could break up
'Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane or make a mistake
So say it again
Oh Nina, you should go Nina
'Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina
Oh won't you leave me now
And I've been livin' on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina
'Cause that's you and me both Nina
Oh won't you leave me now, now
And every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie
With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own
'Cause every day when I was away we'd only speak on the phone
Watching Blue Planet, creating new habits
Acting as if we were two rabbits
And then you'd vanish
Back to the borough with all the Celtics
I disappear, you call me selfish
I understand but I can't help it
I put my job over everything except my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation 'cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break
Just re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it's too late
So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane
But in a day we'll have to say it again
Oh Nina, you should go Nina
'Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina
Oh won't you leave me now
And I've been livin' on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina
'Cause that's you and me both Nina
Oh won't you leave me now, now
Love will come and love will go
But you can make it on your own
Sing that song
Go oh won't you leave me now
People grow and fall apart
But you can mend your broken heart
Take it back go oh won't you leave me now
Oh Nina, you should go Nina
(Love will come and love will go)
Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina
(But you can make it on your own)
Oh won't you leave me now
(Sing that song, go oh won't you leave me now)
And I've been livin' on the road Nina
(People grow and fall apart)
But then again you should know Nina
(But you can mend your broken heart)
Cause that's you and me both Nina
(Take it back, go oh won't you leave me now)
Oh won't you leave me now now
Loving can hurt
Loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
Times forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer
'Til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home
Loving can heal
Loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know (know)
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
Times forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer
'Til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
That's OK, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat
Where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well, that's OK, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
When I'm away
I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost
Back on 6th street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home
I've been spinning now for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinning on my mind
Sipping on red wine
I've been sitting here for ages
Ripping out the pages
How'd I get so faded?
How'd I get so faded?
Oh, no, no, don't leave me alone lonely now
If you loved me how'd you never learn?
Oh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Well, tell me when it kicks in
I've been looking for a lover
Thought I'd find her in a bottle
God, make me another one
I'll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord, forgive me for the things I've done
I was never meant to hurt no one
I saw scars upon a broken-hearted lover
Oh, no, no, don't leave me alone lonely now
If you loved me how'd you never learn?
Oh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Well, tell me when it kicks in
Well, tell me when it kicks in
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back
We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people who talk too much
You got the kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us
Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, so in love
You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife Sea
And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness
Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, so in love
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, love, love, love
So in love
You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
And in a moment I knew you, Beth
I've known it for a long time
Daddy wakes up to a drink at nine
Disappearing all night
I don't wanna know where he's been lying
I know what I wanna do
Wanna run away, run away with you
Gonna grab clothes, six in the morning go
How long you leaving?
Well, dad, just don't expect me back this evening
Oh, it could take a bit of time to heal this
It's been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway, but
I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just run away and be on my own
I've never seen my dad cry
Cold as stone in the kitchen light
I'll tell you it's about time
But I was raised to keep quiet
This is what I'm gonna do
Gonna run away, gonna make that move
Gonna grab clothes and when it's morning go
How long you leaving?
Well, dad, just don't expect me back this evening
Oh, it could take a bit of time to heal this
It's been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway, but
I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just run away and be on my own
Backpack and a flat cap turned to the back
As I packed my clothes up
My dad wasn't down with that plan to attack, intends to show love
I don't wanna live this way
Gonna take my things and go
If things change in a matter of days
I could be persuaded to hold on
Mama was the same
None of us are saints I guess that God knows that
I don't wanna run away
And one of these days I might just show that
Put my home in a suitcase
Tie both shoe laces and hope that
Things change, but for now I'll leave town with a backpack on my shoulder
I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just run away and be on my own
No, I don't wanna hate you
Just wish you'd never gone for the man
And waited two weeks at least
Before you let him take you
I stayed true
I kind of knew you liked the dude from private school
He's waiting for the time to move
I knew he had his eyes on you
He's not the right guy for you
Don't hate me cause I write the truth
No I would never lie to you
But it was never fine to lose you
And what a way to find out
It never came from my mouth
You never changed your mind
But you were just afraid to mind out
But fuck it, I won't be changing the subject I love it
I'll make your little secret public it's nothing
I'm just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with in your closet to get back at me
Trapped and I'm lacking sleep
Fact is you're mad at me because I backtrack so casually
You're practically my family
If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be
But tragically our love just lost the will to live
But would I kill to give it one more shot
I think not
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore
Recently I tend to zone out
Up in my headphones to Holocene
You promised your body but I'm away so much
I stay more celibate than in a monastery
I'm not cut out for life on the road
Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much
And at the time we'd just go, so sue me
I guess I'm not the man that you need
Ever since you went to uni
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad
But when I broke the industry
That's when I broke your heart
I was supposed to chart and celebrate
But good things are over fast
I know it's hard to deal with and see this
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
Then I turn the music off
And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus
I never really want to believe this
Got advice from my dad and he
Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need
I guess I'm unaware of it
Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore
And since you left
I've given up my days off
It's what I need to stay strong
I know you have a day job
But mine is 24/7
I feel like writing a book
I guess I lied in the hook
Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could
The irony is if my career and music didn't exist
In 6 years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid
I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink
And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it's
Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill
And I'd be writing my will before I'm 27
I'll die from a thrill
Go down in history as just a wasted talent
Can I face the challenge
Or did I make a mistake erasing?
It's only therapy
My thoughts just get ahead of me
Eventually I'll be fine I know that it was never meant to be
Either way I guess I'm not prepared
But I'll say this
These things happen for a reason and you can't change shit
Take my apology
I'm sorry for the honesty
But I had to get this off my chest
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore
When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And, darling, I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And, baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me—I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So, honey, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way (mmm...)
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And, baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
That, baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
Thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are (oh, oh)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lo-ud
So, baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh, darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
But maybe we found love right where we are
Oh, baby, we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are
Things were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your memory
And if you fell to your death today
I hope that heaven is your resting place
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain
But then that could have been the medicine
And now you're lying in the bed again
Either way I'll cry with the rest of them
My father told me, son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
You're not the only one
Although my grandma used to say
He used to sing
Darlin' hold me in your arms
The way you did last night
And we'll lie inside
For a little while here oh
I could look into your eyes
Until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light and life and love
Put your open lips on mine
And slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together oh
With your body next to mine
Our hearts will beat as one
And we set alight
We're afire love
Love, love
Things were all good yesterday
Then the devil took your breath away
Now we're left here in the pain
Black suit black tie standing in the rain
And now my family is one again
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend
Came to my mind I should paint it with a pen
Six years old I remember when
My father told me, son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
You're not the only one
Although my grandma used to say
He used to sing
Darlin' hold me in your arms
The way you did last night
And we'll lie inside
For a little while here oh
I could look into your eyes
Until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light and life and love
Put your open lips on mine
And slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together oh
With your body next to mine
Our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight
We're afire love
Love, love
See the love, the love, the love, the love
My father and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
And my mother and all of my family
Rise from their seats to say hallelujah
And my brother and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
(To my brother and my sister, yeah, ah)
My father and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing
Hallelujah
To the love, the love, the love, the love
I'm not a rapper I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know
You'll find me ripping the written out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten
'Cause plagiarism is hidden
Watch how I sit on the rhythm
Prisoner with a vision
Signs of a label
But didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didn't
So perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system
And you could say that I'm driven
And now it's onto the next saga
We drink the best lager
I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather
I do my own thing now
And get respect after
And I'm avoiding the 'caine
Like it was Get Carter
For four years I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded
Like a paper weight
At 16 years old yeah I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked
Went from sleeping at a subway station
To sleeping with a movie star
And adding to the population
Not my imagination
I don't wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax?
I take it back now
Mmmm come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No
I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack I'll be singing the news
Tryna act like Jack Black
When I bring it to school
I make a beat with my feet
By just hittin' the loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove
That I can fit in these shoes
I give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out on the scene
Like an opal fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again that's what they're supposed to do
And I'm supposed to be calm
I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whispering everything that happens
Is from now on
I'll be ready to start again
By the end of the song
This is like claiming I handled it wrong
But then I've never had an enemy
Except the NME but I'll be selling
Twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me
And festival fees are healthier than a Dalmatian on Pedigree
Singing for the masses rubber dingied rapids
I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic
I'm battling for respect and I don't know if I have it
This song's from the heart cover the planet
I take it back now
Mmmm come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No
And take it back now
Now I don't ever wanna be perfect
'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone's got to win worst dressed
Taking my first steps into the scene giving me focus
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition
'Cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written
Now absence can make your heart ache
But drinking absinthe can change your mind state
Vividly need to let my liver be
And I'll say it again living life on the edge with a close handful of friends
Is good advice from the man that took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
'Cause that's how it's supposed to be
I'm screaming out vocally
It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams
But, but I just write schemes
I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be
But more likely
You find me
In the back room of a dive bar with my mates
Having a pint with McDaid
Discussing records we made
And every single second knowing
That we'll never betray
The way we were raised
Remembering our background
Sat down,
That's how we plan it out
It's time to take it back now
Mmmm come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No
I can taste salt water
And if I blink again
You'll be sinking in
So we'll learn to swim in the oceans you made
I'll hold ya and you'll think of him
And pretty soon you'll be floating away
And I'll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in the throat, love
And I'm captain of this sinking boat now
With just one armband to carry me home
When salted tears won't dry
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
Your eyes
I still taste salt water
On my lips from your kiss, bitterness
And I'll drown within the oceans you made
And I hate to love you, these cuffs are covered in your make up
I'll never trust you again
You can just be a friend
And I'll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in the throat, love
And I'm captain of this sinking boat now
With just one armband to carry me home
When salted tears won't dry
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
Your eyes, your lips, your mouth
Your thighs, your back, you drive me wild
Tonight, the fact is I...
I'm on the way home
I'm on the way home
I lied, I tried to cry but I'm
I'm drowning in the oceans you made
When salted tears won't dry
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the lord's house
But stopped at the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now, the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon, that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy, when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me, is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lies, and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point, I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
Instead I look in the mirror, questioning what I've become
Guess it's a stereotypical day, for someone like me
Without a nine to five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors I'll find another use for the key, and you'll see
I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more
I am another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own so here I'll stay
Save your loving arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the picture perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the route of all evil, and fame is hell
Relationships and hearts you fix, they break as well
And ain't nobody want to see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream and this should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm reverend run
I beg you don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Conversations with my father on the A14
Age 12, telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people dad and they know me
With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans
Wembley stadium crowds, two hundred and forty thou
I may have grown up but I hope that Damian's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasing it now, somehow
I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more
I am another one to take the sting away
Oh I am happy on my own so here I'll stay
Well save your loving arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
Where I'm heading who knows
My heart will stay the same
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
Where I'm heading who knows
My pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then
Take me back to when
I found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long
I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer
And I miss the way
You make me feel
And it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night
I don't reckon that I did it right
I was younger then,
Take me back to when
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long
Oh, how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer
And I miss the way
You make me feel
And it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home
And I'm on my way
I still remember these old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way
You make me feel
And it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Maybe I came on too strong
Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong
Oh just a little bit wrong
Baby I apologise for it
I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
I've been known to give my all
And jumping in harder than
10,000 rocks on the lake
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
You're a mystery
I have travelled the world
And there's no other girl like you, no one
What's your history?
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
Cause I heard you do
I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And lie awake, every day
Don't know how much I can take
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
I've been known to give my all
Sitting back, looking at
Every mess that I made
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go (mmmm)
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow (mmmm)
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now (mmmm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van The Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
And now I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead (mmmm)
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date (mmmm)
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (mmmm)
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay (mmmm)
And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
And I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead (mmmm)
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes you're holding mine
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess
I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it,
Darling, you look perfect tonight
Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress
Looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this
Darling, you look perfect tonight
No, no, no
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, Baby, I just want to dance
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table, with Johnny riding as shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance, you know
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, Baby, I just want to dance
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called, was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to Cèilidh, singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me, you know
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, Baby, I just want to dance
My pretty little Galway girl
My my my Galway girl
Now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
Finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm going to put you in a song that I write
About a Galway girl and a perfect night
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, Baby, I just want to dance
My pretty little Galway girl
My my my Galway girl
Walking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arms
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah you look happier, you do
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal baby
If you're moving on with someone new
Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself you're happier
Aren't you?
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling I am still in love with you
But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Baby you look happier, you do
I knew one day you'd fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I'll be waiting here for you
I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I heard he's on a new diet and watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy so that's fine by me
But still, I'm just keeping it real, still looking at your Instagram and I'll be creeping a little
I'll be trying not to double tap, from way back, cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when you used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't superman, just a young boy trying to be loved
So let me give it to you
I don't wanna know about your new man, cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be calling me up trying to
Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man, we'll get there eventually
I know you're missing all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
Your new man rents a house in the burb, and wears a man bag on his shoulder but I call it a purse
Every year he goes to Malaga, with all the fellas, drinks beer but has a six pack, I'm kind of jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors in winter at nighttime, and every time a rap song comes on
He makes a gun sign, says chune, boydem light up the room
But enough about him, girl let's talk about you
You were the type of girl that sat beside the water reading
Eating a packet of crisps but you will never find you cheating
Now you're eating kale, hitting the gym, keeping up with Kylie & Kim
In the back of the club kissing a boy that ain't him
Ok you need to be alone, and if you wanna talk about it you can call my phone
I just thought that I would tell you cause you oughta know
You're still a young girl trying to be loved
So let me give it to you
I don't wanna know about your new man, cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be calling me up trying to
Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man, we'll get there eventually
I know you're missing all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
Baby, I'm not trying to ruin your week
But you act so differently
When you're with him I know you're lonely
Please, remember you're still free, to make the choice and leave
And don't call me up you need to show me
I don't wanna know about your new man, cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be calling me up trying to
Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man, we'll get there eventually
I know you're missing all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
Know about me, know, know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man, he don't wanna know
She is the sweetest thing that I know
You should see the way she holds me when the lights go low
Shakes my soul like a pot hole, every time
Took my heart upon a one way trip
Guess she went wandering off with it
Unlike most women I know
This one will bring it back whole
Daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead
Oh my baby, lately I know
That every night I'll kiss you you'll say in my ear
Oh we're in love aren't we?
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah yeah
She is the river flow in Orwell
And tin wind chimes used for doorbells
Fields and trees and her smell, fill my lungs
Spent my summer time beside her
And the rest of the year the same
She is the flint that sparks the lighter
And the fuel that will hold the flame
Oh roses roses laid upon your bed spread
Oh my, hold this, oh this, I know
That every night I'll kiss you you'll say in my ear
Oh we're in love aren't we?
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah
Well I found love in the inside
The arms of a woman I know
She is the lighthouse in the night that will safely guide me home
And I'm not scared of passing over
Or the thought of growing old
Because from now until I go
Every night I'll kiss you you'll say in my ear
Oh we're in love aren't we?
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah yeah
Every night I'll kiss you you'll say in my ear
Oh we're in love aren't we?
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
yeah
You know hearts don't break around here
Ain't got a soapbox I can stand upon
But God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song
My daddy told me, Son, don't you get involved
In politics, religions, other peoples' quarrels.
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene,
I know when I have children, they will know what it means
And I'll pass on these things my family's given to me
Just love and understanding positivity
We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but Lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
Saying love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
The revolution's coming, it's a minute away
I saw people marching in the streets today
You know we are made up of love and hate
But both of them are balanced on a razor blade
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know, I'm all for people following their dreams
Just re-remember life is more than fitting in your jeans
It's love and understanding positivity
We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but Lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
Saying love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene,
You know the future's in the hands of you and me
So let's all get together, we can all be free
Spread love and understanding positivity
We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but Lord knows
Everybody's talking about exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
Saying love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
I was twenty four years old
When I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty two grand kids now growing old
In the house that your brother bought ya
On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father but her daddy said, No
You can't marry my daughter
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border
Well, I met her at Guy's in the second world war
And she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children now growing old
Five sons and three daughters
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border
From her snow white streak in her jet black hair
Over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire, in our old armchairs
You know Nancy I adore ya
From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried about the king and crown
Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
There's no difference, I assure ya
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border
L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sun down and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're heading downtown
('Round here)
Everybody's looking for a come-up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out
We don't fit in well
'Cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help
Getting out of this conversation, here
You look stunning, dear
So don't ask that question here
This is my only fear
That we become
Beautiful people
Drop-top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
What d'you do? and Who d'you know?
Inside the world of
Beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Pre-nups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party
That's not who we are
(We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful
Yeah, that's not who we are
(We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful
(L.A., mm)
Drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere
(Nowhere, nowhere)
I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there
(All night)
I'm not fazed by all the lights and flashing cameras
'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care
We don't fit in well
We are just ourselves
I could use some help
Getting out of this conversation here
You look stunning, dear
So don't ask that question here
This is my only fear
That we become
Beautiful people
Drop-top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
What d'you do? and Who d'you know?
Inside the world of
Beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Pre-nups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party
That's not who we are
(We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful (yeah)
Yeah, that's not who we are
(We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful
She got the mm brown eyes, caramel thighs, long hair, no wedding ring, hey
I saw you lookin' from across the way and now I really wanna know your name
She got the mm white dress, but when she's wearing less
Man, you know that she drives me crazy
The mm brown eyes, beautiful smile
You know I love watching you do your thing
I love her hips, curves, lips say the words
Te amo mami, te amo mami
I kiss her, this love is like a dream
So join me in this bed that I'm in
Push up on me and sweat darling
So I'm gonna put my time in
I won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
He got the mm green eyes, givin' me signs that he really wants to know my name, hey
I saw you lookin' from across the way and suddenly I'm glad I came, I
Ven para acá, quiero bailar, toma mi mano
Quiero sentir tu cuerpo en mí, estás temblando
Mm green eyes, taking your time, knowing that we'll never be the same
I love his lips 'cause he says the words
Te amo mami, te amo mami
Don't wake up, this love is like a dream
So join me in this bed that I'm in
Push up on me and sweat darling
So I'm gonna put my time in
I won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me (Rrrr)
Flawless diamonds
In a green field near Buenos Aires
Until the sun's rising
We won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
You never live till you risk your life
You wanna shine, you gotta get more ice
Am I your lover or I'm just your vice?
A little crazy but I'm just your type (Okurr)
You want the lips and the curves, need the whips and the furs
And the diamonds I prefer in my closet his and hers (Aye)
He want the little mamacita margarita
I think that Ed got a little jungle fever (Aye)
You are more than (You are more than)
Something boring (Something boring)
Legs open, tongue out, Michael Jordan, ugh
Go exploring, something foreign (Skrrt skrrt)
Bust it open, rain forest, it be pouring
Yeah, kiss me like you need me, rub me like a genie
Pull up to my spot in Lamborghini
'Cause you gotta see me, never leave me
You got a girl that can finally do it all
Drop an album, drop a baby, but I never drop the ball (Ugh)
So join me in this bed that I'm in
Push up on me and sweat darling
So I'm gonna put my time in
I won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Come south of the border, border
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
I have grown up, I am a father now
Everything has changed, but I am still the same somehow
You know I've never been afraid of death
But now I wanna see the things that haven't happened yet
I still love getting out of my mind, I should it cut down
I still know people I don't like and I should cut them out
I feel embarrassed 'bout the things that I did in my youth
'Cause now I have a child, I know one day that she'll go through it
Freight cargo, dot stops, and aeroplanes
Late night calls, signal is in and out again
Feeling low on serotonin and better days
Go, go, go, but every moment you're here with me
Time stops to still
When you are in my arms, it always will
And life, life is changing tides
I lost the confidence in who I was
Too busy trying to chase the high and get the numbers up
I have the same dream every night
A bullet through my brain the moment that I close my eyes
I still have to lean on a shoulder when I've broken down
And I have people that depend on me to sort them out
I sometimes fantasise I disappear without a trace
Have no regrets but wish I did things in a different way
Low fly zone, lawsuits, and film stars
Headline wrote the princess and the face scar
Broken bones, break-ins, and Babylon
Go, go, go, but every moment you're here with me
Time stops to still
When you are in my arms, it always will
And life, life is changing tides
Time stops to still
When you are in my arms, it always will
And life, life is changing tides
I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
Strawberries and then something more
Ooh yeah, I want it all
Lipstick on my guitar
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
Go dancing underneath the stars
Ooh yeah, I want it all
Mmm, you got me feeling like
I wanna be that guy
I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile
I wanna feel like I
Like my soul's on fire
I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singing like
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up
Give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance till the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up
Give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance till the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back
Into the car
On the backseat in the moonlit dark
Wrap me up between your legs and arms
Ooh, I can't get enough
You know you could tear me apart
Put me back together and take my heart
I never thought that I could love this hard
Ooh, I can't get enough
Mmm, you got me feeling like
I wanna be that guy
I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile
I wanna feel like I
Like my soul's on fire
I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singing like
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up
Give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance till the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up
Give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance till the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back
Baby, you burn so hot
You make me shiver with the fire you got
This thing we started, I don't want it to stop
You know you make me shiver-er-er
Baby, you burn so hot
You make me shiver with the fire you got
This thing we started, I don't want it to stop
You know you make me shiver
Yeah, you got me singing like
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up
Give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance till the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back
(Oh no) And we'll say
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up
Give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance till the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back, hey
I thought it'd feel different playing Wembley
80,000 singing with me
It's what I've been chasing 'cause this is the dream
When it was all over, I cleared out the room
Grabbed a couple beers, just me and you
Then we start talking the way that we do
Ain't it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man
Little moments that pass us by
Oh, but I remember
The first kiss, the first night, the first song that made you cry
The first drink, red wine, on a step in Brooklyn
I still feel the first fight, but we both made it out alive
And I can't wait to make a million more first times
The greatest thing that I have achieved
Is four little words down on one knee
You said, Darling, are you joking?
And I just said, Please.
Ain't it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man
Little moments that pass us by
Oh, but I remember
The first kiss, the first night, the first song that made you cry
The first look in your eyes when I said, I love you.
I can still feel the butterflies from when we stumbled home that night
I can't wait to make a million more first times
Ain't it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man
Little moments that pass us by
Oh, but I remember
The first kiss, first night, first song that made you cry
First dance in moonlight in your parents' garden
I can't wait to see everything that's yet to be
Our first child, and then a million more first times
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
We took the long way 'round
And burned 'til the fun ran out, now
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
This is a dark parade
Another rough patch to rain on
To rain on
I know your friends may say
This is a cause for celebration
Hip hip hooray love
Photographs in sepia tones
So still the fire is barely fighting the cold
Alone
There are times when I can feel your ghost
Just when I'm almost letting you go
But the cards were stacked against us both
I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were
You were the first full stop love that will never leave
And, baby, you will never be lost on me
This is a God damn shame
I never wanted to break it
And leave us tainted
Know I should walk away
But I just can't replace us
Or even erase us
The car was stuck, the engine stalled
Both of us got caught out in the snow
Alone
There were times when I forget the lows
And think the highs were all that we'd ever know
The cards were stacked against us both
I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were
You were the first full stop love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me
Lost on me
Baby, you will never be lost on me
Lost on me
I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were
You were the first full stop love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me
Lost on me
Graffiti on the overpass 
How was I to know?
It's a crazy thing
I showed you my hand
And you still let me win
And who was I to say
That this was meant to be?
The road that was broken
Brought us together
And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would give you a diamond ring
When I fold, you see the best in me
The joker and the queen
I was upside down
From the outside in
You came to the table
And you went all in
With a single word
And a gentle touch
You turned a moment
Into forever
And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that could give you a diamond ring
When I fold, you see the best in me
The joker and the queen
And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would give you a diamond ring
When I folded, you saw the best in me
The joker and the queen
The joker and queen
