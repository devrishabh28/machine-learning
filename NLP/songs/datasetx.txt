I found a love, for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess
I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it
Darling, you look perfect tonight
Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a lover, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this
Darling, you look perfect tonight
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight
One, two, three, four
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true
It's true, my bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights, and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true
It's true, my bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
We took the long way 'round
And burned 'til the fun ran out, now
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true
It's true, my bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
(Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)
I'm in love with your body
(Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)
I'm in love with your body
(Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
(Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)
I'm in love with your body
(Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)
I'm in love with your body
(Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on (I'm in love with your body), be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on (I'm in love with your body), be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on (I'm in love with your body), be my baby, come on
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped at the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon, they kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And everyday that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lies and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become
I guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or an uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors, I find another use for the key
And you'll see
I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more, higher
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser
I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of evil and fame is hell
Relationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Our conversations with my father on the A14
Age twelve telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
With my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd's two-hundred-and-forty-thou'
I may have grown up but I hope that Damien's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now
Somehow
I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more, higher
Another one to take the sting away
Oh, I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows
But my heart will stay the same
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows
My pain, eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, Baby, I just want to dance
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, Baby, I just want to dance
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to Cèilidh singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sang so sweet
A capella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, Baby, I just want to dance
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, Baby, I just want to dance
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
Walking down 29th and Park
I saw you in another's arms
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said somethin' to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're movin' on with someone new
'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle
And telling myself you're happier, aren't you?
(Hey, yeah, hey, yeah, hey, yeah)
Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you (hey, yeah, hey, yeah)
But ain't nobody need you like I do (hey, yeah, hey, yeah)
I know that there's others that deserve you (hey, yeah, hey, yeah)
But my darlin', I am still in love with you
But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
'Cause baby, you look happier, you do
I knew one day you'd fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I'll be waitin' here for you
I was twenty-four years old
When I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty-two grand kids now growing old
In that house that your brother bought ya
On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father, but her daddy said, no
You can't marry my daughter
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border
Well, I met her at Guy's in the second world war
And she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children now growing old
Five sons and three daughters
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border
From the snow white streak in her jet black hair
Over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs
You know Nancy, I adore ya
From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried about the king and crown
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
There's no difference, I assure ya
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border
I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
Strawberries and somethin' more
Ooh yeah, I want it all
Lipstick on my guitar (ooh)
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
Go dancin' underneath the stars
Ooh yeah, I want it all
Mm, you got me feelin' like
I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singin' like
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say, ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
Into the car
On the backseat in the moonlit dark
Wrap me up between your legs and arms
Ooh, I can't get enough
You know you could tear me apart (ooh)
Put me back together and take my heart
I never thought that I could love this hard
Ooh, I can't get enough
Mm, you got me feeling like
I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singin' like
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say, ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
Baby, you burn so hot
You make me shiver with the fire you got
This thing we started, I don't want it to stop
You know you make me shiver-er-er
Baby, you burn so hot
You make me shiver with the fire you got
This thing we started, I don't want it to stop
You know you make me shiver
Yeah, you got me singin' like
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back (oh no)
And we'll say, ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back, hey
This is a dark parade
Another rough patch to rain on, to rain on
I know your friends may say
This is a cause for celebration, hip-hip-hooray, love
Photographs in sepia tones
It's so still, the fire's barely fighting the cold, alone
There are times when I can feel your ghost
Just when I'm almost letting you go
The cards were stacked against us both
I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were, you were the first full stop
Love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me
This is a goddamn shame
I never wanted to break it, or leave us tainted
Know I should walk away
But I just can't replace us, or even erase us
The car was stuck, the engine stalled
And both of us got caught out in the snow, alone
There were times when I forget the lows
And think the highs were all that we'd ever known
The cards were stacked against us both
I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were, you were the first full stop
Love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me
Lost on me
Baby, you will never be lost on me
Lost on me
Well, I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were, you were the first full stop
Love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Lost on me
Ooh, graffiti on the overpass
Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen, still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home
Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
Hmm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die
Hmm, we keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
That's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Oh, you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh, girl, for goodness' sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well, I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinkin' I still care, I don't, but
You still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job
Didn't see what's going on, but now I know
I'm better sleeping on my own
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinkin' I still care, I don't, but
You still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job
Didn't see what's going on, but now I know
I'm better sleeping on my own
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself (yeah)
And if you think (you think) that I'm (that I'm)
Still holdin' on to somethin' (holdin' on, no)
You should go and love yourself
Well, let me tell you a story
About a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend
When she's around, he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken
And it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right
But did you know that I loved you?
Or were you not aware?
You're the smile on my face
And I ain't goin' nowhere
I'm here to make you happy
I'm here to see you smile
I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while
Who's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all
Oh, my love
But you can't fly unless you let your
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall
Well, I can tell you're afraid of
What this might do
'Cause we got such an amazing friendship
And that you don't wanna lose
Well, I don't wanna lose it either
And I don't think I can stand sitting around
While you're hurting babe, so take my hand
Well, did you know you're an angel
Who forgot how to fly?
Did you know that it breaks my heart
Every time I see you cry?
'Cause I know that a piece of you's gone
Every time you're done wrong
I'm the shoulder you're crying on
And I hope, by the time that I'm done
With this song, I'll have figured out
Who's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all
Oh, my love (my love)
But you can't fly unless you let your
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
But if you spread your wings
You can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let your
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall
Who's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all
Oh, my love (my love)
But you can't fly unless you let your
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall
Who's gonna make you fall in love? (In love)
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all (don't have to be scared, don't have to be scared at all)
Oh, my love
But you can't fly unless you let your-
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
But if you spread your wings
You can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let your
Let yourself fall
Maybe I stare too much, maybe not long enough
Funny how I forget to blink
When you let down your hair, dancin' like no one's there
I know I'm where I'm supposed to be
Say, I love you under my breath
More times than you can digest
Music every time I hear your name, oh
Your head's layin' right on my chest
Sun's up, but I still ain't got no rest
Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep, I'd rather fall in love
When I can't feel you, I feel out of touch
Two seconds without you's like two months
Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep, I'd rather fall in love
'Cause eternity with you ain't long enough
Two seconds without you's like two months
And that's too much
Love the way you love your mom
Take on all your friends problems
Still somehow stop the world for us, oh-oh
I still relieve that second
I made my biggest blessing
Prayed for you, look what God has turned
Say, I love you under my breath
More times than you can digest
Music every time I hear your name, oh
Your head's layin' right on my chest
Sun's up, but I still ain't got no rest
Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep, I'd rather fall in love
When I can't feel you, I feel out of touch
Two seconds without you's like two months
Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep, I'd rather fall in love
'Cause eternity with you ain't long enough
Two seconds without you's like two months
And that's too much
It's the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets, spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'ma be under the mistletoe
I don't wanna miss out on the holiday
But I can't stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'ma be under the mistletoe
With you, shawty, with you
With you, shawty, with you
With you, under the mistletoe
Everyone's gathering around the fire
Chestnuts roasting like a hot July

But I'ma be under the mistletoe
Word on the street, Santa's coming tonight
Reindeer's flying through the sky so high
I should be making a list, I know
But I'ma be under the mistletoe
With you, shawty, with you
With you, shawty, with you
With you, under the mistletoe
With you, shawty, with you

The way I followed my heart
And it led me to a miracle
Ayy love (ayy love), don't you buy me nothing (don't you buy me nothing)
'Cause I am feeling one thing, your lips on my lips
That's a merry, merry Christmas
It's the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets, spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow (I know)
But I'ma be under the mistletoe

Show me, baby, that you love me so-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh (oh, whoa, oh whoa)
When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it's evergreen
Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are, oh
So baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh baby, we found love right where we are (maybe)
And we found love right where we are
We are, we are, we are

She'd take the world off my shoulders
If it was ever hard to move
She'd turn the rain to a rainbow
When I was living in the blue
Why then, if she is so perfect
Do I still wish that it was you?
Perfect don't mean that it's working
So what can I do? (Ooh)
When you're out of sight
In my mind
'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes
And that's where I find a glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch
But I'm thinking of the way it was
Said I'm fine and said I moved on
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hoping I'll find
A glimpse of us
Tell me he savors your glory
Does he laugh the way I did?
Is this a part of your story?
One that I had never lived
Maybe one day you'll feel lonely
And in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse
Maybe you'll start slipping slowly
And find me again
When you're out of sight
In my mind
'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes
And that's where I find a glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch
But I'm thinking of the way it was
Said I'm fine and said I moved on
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hoping I'll find
A glimpse of us
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes
And that's where I find a glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch
But I'm thinking of the way it was
Said I'm fine and said I moved on
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hoping I'll find
A glimpse of us
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh, la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat dripping off me
Before I even knew her name, la-la-la
It felt like ooh, la-la-la
Yeah, no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Tequila sunrise
Her body fit right in my hands, la-la-la
It felt like ooh, la-la-la, yeah
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh, la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you know I love it when you call me señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh, la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
Locked in the hotel
There's just some things that never change
You say we're just friends
But friends don't know the way you taste, la-la-la
'Cause you know it's been a long time coming
Don't you let me fall, oh
Ooh, when your lips undress me
Hooked on your tongue
Ooh, love, your kiss is deadly
Don't stop
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh, la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you know I love it when you call me señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh, la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la (true, la-la)
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
All along I've been coming for ya (for ya)
And I hope it meant something to ya (ooh)
Call my name, I'll be coming for ya
Coming for ya, coming for ya, coming for ya
For ya
For ya (oh, she loves it when I call)
For ya
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
This night is cold in the kingdom
I can feel you fade away
From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
Your steps keep me awake
Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slippin' through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please
Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leavin', baby, let me down slowly
Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leavin', baby, let me down slowly
Cold skin, drag my feet on the tile
As I'm walking down the corridor
And I know we haven't talked in a while
So I'm looking for an open door
Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slippin' through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please
Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leavin', baby, let me down slowly
Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leavin', baby, let me down slowly
And I can't stop myself from fallin' (down) down
And I can't stop myself from fallin' (down) down
And I can't stop myself from fallin' (down) down
And I can't stop myself from fallin' (down) down
Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leavin', baby, let me down slowly
Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leavin', baby, let me down slowly
If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leavin', baby, let me down slowly
I used to believe
We were burning on the edge of something beautiful
Something beautiful
Selling a dream
Smoke and mirrors keep us waiting on a miracle
On a miracle
Say, go through the darkest of days
Heaven's a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down
Oh, it's been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
(Oh, baby, baby)
Don't fall asleep
At the wheel, we've got a million miles ahead of us
Miles ahead of us
All that we need
Is a rude awakening to know we're good enough (yeah)
Know we're good enough
Say, go through the darkest of days
Heaven's a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down
Oh, it's been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
(Oh, baby, baby)
Whoa
(Girl, never let you go) Wooh
Oh, nah-nah-nah-nah
(Never let you go)
Yeah, yeah (girl, never let you go)
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
I thought that I'd been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life
Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
Shaking, falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself
Aching, begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart, cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seeing red on my own
Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
Shaking, falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself
Aching, begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Needle and the thread, gotta get you outta my head
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread, gotta get you outta my head
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead (gonna wind up dead)
Needle and the thread, gotta get you outta my head (gotta get you outta my head)
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead (wind up dead)
Needle and the thread, gotta get you outta my head, get you outta my head
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
Shaking, falling onto my knees (falling on my knees)
And now that I'm without your kisses (without you)
I'll be needing stitches (and I'll be needing stitches)
Tripping over myself
Aching, begging you to come help (begging baby, please)
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
I wanna follow where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let her take control
'Cause everytime that she gets close, yeah
She pulls me in enough to keep me guessing (mmm)
And maybe I should stop and start confessing
Confessing, yeah
Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
There's nothing holdin' me back
There's nothing holdin' me back
She says that she's never afraid
Just picture everybody naked
She really doesn't like to wait
Not really into hesitation
Pulls me in enough to keep me guessing, whoa
And maybe I should stop and start confessing
Confessing, yeah
Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
There's nothing holdin' me back
'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright
If you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright
'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright
If you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright, we would be alright
Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back (oh whoa)
There's nothing holdin' me back
I feel so free when you're with me, baby
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
You've got a hold of me
Don't even know your power
I stand a hundred feet
But I fall when I'm around ya
Show me an open door
Then you go and slam it on me
I can't take anymore
I'm saying, baby
Please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
I'd drive through the night
Just to be near you, baby
Heart open, testify
Tell me that I'm not crazy
I'm not asking for a lot
Just that you're honest with me
My pride is all I got
I'm saying, baby
Please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me
I'm a puppet on your strings
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice
Oh, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me?
I'm a puppet on your string
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
I'm begging you for mercy, mercy
I'm begging you, begging you, please, baby
I'm begging you for mercy, mercy
Ooh, I'm begging you, I'm begging you, yeah
Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood
Laying on the bathroom floor, feeling nothing
I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me something
I could take to ease my mind slowly
Just have a drink and you'll feel better
Just take her home and you'll feel better
Keep telling me that it gets better
Does it ever?
Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood
I'm looking through my phone again, feeling anxious
Afraid to be alone again, I hate this
I'm tryna find a way to chill, can't breathe, oh
Is there somebody who could help me?
It's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood (oh)

Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up

So when it gets hard, don't be afraid
We don't care what them people say
I love it when you don't take no
I love it when you do what you want 'cause you just said so

We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time, I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily
Don't wanna know
Kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's holding onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
I just hope you're lying next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you might want me to
Come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong
Don't wanna know
If you're looking into her eyes
If she's holding onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
Like we used to do
Don't wanna know
Kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's giving it to you just right
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
We don't talk anymore (don't wanna know)
Kind of dress you're wearing tonight (oh)
If he's holding onto you so tight (oh)
The way I did before
We don't talk anymore (I overdosed)
Should've known your love was a game (oh)
Now I can't get you out of my brain (whoa)
Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore
When I was six years old, I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long
I know I've grown, but I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and
Getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night
I don't reckon that I did it right, but
I was younger then, take me back to when
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long
Oh, how we've grown, but I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill (hill)
Over the castle on the hill (hill)
Over the castle on the hill (hill)
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids, but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by, but
These people raised me
And I can't wait to go home
And I'm on my way
I still remember these old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill (hill)
Over the castle on the hill (hill)
Over the castle on the hill
Things were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your memory
And if you fell to your death today
I hope that heaven is your resting place
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain
But then that could've been the medicine
And now you're lying in the bed again
Either way, I'll cry with the rest of them
And my father told me, Son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
And you're not the only one
Although my grandma used to say
That he used to sing
Darling, hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while here, oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light and life and love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together, oh
With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love
Love, love
And things were all good yesterday
But then the devil took your breath away
And now we're left here in the pain
Black suit, black tie, standing in the rain
And now my family is one again
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend
Came to my mind, I should paint it with a pen
Six years old, I remember when
My father told me, Son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
And you're not the only one
Although my grandma used to say
That he used to sing
Darling, hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while here, oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light and life and love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together, oh
With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love
Love, love
See the love, the love, the love, the love
See the love, the love, the love, the love
See the love, the love, the love, the love
And my father and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
And my mother and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
And my brother and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
(And all my brothers and my sisters, yeah, ah)
And my father and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
To the love, the love, the love, the love
To the love, the love, the love, the love
To the love, the love, the love, the love
You're the light, you're the night
You're the color of my blood
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much
You're the fear, I don't care
'Cause I've never been so high
Follow me through the dark
Let me take you past our satellites
You can see the world you brought to life, to life
So love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?
Fading in, fading out
On the edge of paradise
Every inch of your skin is a holy grail I've got to find
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire
Yeah, I'll let you set the pace
'Cause I'm not thinking straight
My head's spinning around I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (like you do)
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (like you do)
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (yeah)
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?
I'll let you set the pace
'Cause I'm not thinking straight
My head's spinning around I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (like you do)
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (yeah)
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (like you do)
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (oh)
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?
Every night in my dreams
I see you, I feel you
That is how I know you go on
Far across the distance
And spaces between us
You have come to show you go on
Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more, you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on
Love can touch us one time
And last for a lifetime
And never let go 'til we're gone
Love was when I loved you
One true time I'd hold to
In my life, we'll always go on
Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on (why does the heart go on?)
Once more, you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on
You're here, there's nothing I fear
And I know that my heart will go on
We'll stay forever this way
You are safe in my heart and
My heart will go on and on
